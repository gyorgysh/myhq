# Changelog

All notable changes to MyHQ are documented here, grouped by release.
Commit links point to `github.com/gyorgysh/myhq`.

## [0.5.6] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- **Recurring Kanban card templates**: mark a card as a recurring template (daily/weekly/monthly cadence) and a fresh backlog copy spawns on schedule; the template stays put and copies don't carry the recurrence. A 60s ticker fires due templates regardless of the panel, and live-refreshes the board over the WebSocket when it does. ([20be716](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/20be716))
- **Live "What's running" status strip**: a panel strip that surfaces the currently active agent runs at a glance. ([59d947e](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/59d947e))
- **Thumbs up/down reactions on assistant messages**: react to a panel-chat reply; a thumbs-up files the response as a durable memory. Backed by `POST /api/chat/react`. ([9462712](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/9462712))
- **Memory tag filtering + bulk-delete mode**: filter the Memory view by tag and multi-select entries for bulk deletion. ([af8ad13](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/af8ad13))
- **Vault search filter + copy-to-clipboard** on the Vault view. ([7a3d046](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/7a3d046))
- **Wizard-first agent menu**: the Workers/agent menu leads with the guided wizard, with a collapsible memory tag list. ([6ab87f4](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/6ab87f4))

### Improved
- **Workers UX**: renamed the create buttons Wizard→Easy and Manual→Advanced, reordered them, pre-filled the Advanced worker `cwd` with the host home directory plus a platform-aware path hint, and added inline form/wizard hints. ([63c845d](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/63c845d), [b2eb1f9](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/b2eb1f9), [36972cc](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/36972cc))
- **Reusable UI primitives**: added `Modal`, `Popover`, and `ConfirmDialog` to `ui.tsx`, and adopted styled confirm dialogs plus a run-agent model badge across the panel. ([6c45608](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/6c45608), [0b972f0](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/0b972f0))
- **Finer memory salience control**: a more precise slider with a numeric input. ([111facb](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/111facb))
- **Updates badge**: a `CheckCircle2` icon on the up-to-date state. ([c1529e0](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/c1529e0))

### Fixed
- **Draft keepalive vs. `crew_ask_president`**: the draft streamer's keepalive now pauses while a `crew_ask_president` call is awaiting the user, so the pending question isn't clobbered. ([204fe09](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/204fe09))

### Security
- **Crash-atomic vault key rotation**: a write-ahead journal makes `rotateKey()` recoverable if the process dies mid-rotation, so secrets can't be left half-re-encrypted. ([c3b611b](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/c3b611b))
- **Wider vault secret-id entropy**: secret ids widened from 32-bit to 64-bit to make them unguessable. ([a5fce6a](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/a5fce6a))
- **Separate ceiling on expensive GET reads**: new `PANEL_READ_RATE_LIMIT` (default 600/window) caps the few heavy read endpoints (memory semantic search, log reads/search, run transcripts) so a runaway client can't flood them, without throttling normal fleet activity. ([be86cdc](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/be86cdc))
- **Loud terminal env warning**: when `PANEL_TERMINAL_INHERIT_ENV=true` exposes the full host environment to the panel shell, the bot now logs a loud warning and DMs allowed users. ([6ee3831](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/6ee3831))

## [0.5.5] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- **Agent avatars**: pick an avatar from a curated set (13 flat-illustration assets) for any worker/Lead; avatars show on Crew/Workers cards and in chat bubbles, and each Lead bot's Telegram profile photo is set automatically on startup. ([a9367b4](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/a9367b4), [187b7bc](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/187b7bc), [569a097](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/569a097), [db6df2e](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/db6df2e))
- **Run Agent modal**: the worker cards' Run Agent button opens a confirmation modal with the agent name, role, working directory, and a one-shot editable prompt (prefilled, never mutating the saved worker). ([13c822d](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/13c822d))
- **Autonomy level selector in Chat**: choose supervised/standard/full per panel chat from the toolbar, replacing the removed `PANEL_CHAT_BYPASS` env flag. ([5f98335](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/5f98335), [6bec138](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/6bec138))
- **Interactive AskUserQuestion widgets** in panel chat, backed by `GET /api/asks` and `POST /api/asks/resolve`. ([78b7f7b](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/78b7f7b))
- **Chat permissions indicator** with browser-resolvable approvals. ([abac35c](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/abac35c))
- **PLANNING badge** shown in chat instead of the raw planning preamble. ([cd80443](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/cd80443))

### Security
- **`crew_delegate` privilege-escalation fix**: the delegated child run's autonomy is now capped at the caller's (only `full`/`auto_until_error` callers grant bypass), and a planning turn files the delegation to the suggestion inbox for explicit approval instead of firing real work. ([26f929c](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/26f929c))

## [0.5.4] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- **Semantic search for tasks and skills**: new `task_search` and `skill_search` MCP tools (auto-allowed) let agents find existing cards and skills by meaning before creating duplicates, via a shared cosine + keyword blend with keyword-only fallback when embeddings are off. ([75c0a08](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/75c0a08))
- **In-panel changelog viewer**: the Updates view fetches the public CHANGELOG, shows a collapsible "What's new" section for releases newer than the installed version, a year-grouped Release history, and falls back to the locally served changelog when GitHub is unreachable. ([edd2240](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/edd2240), [6fcb9fa](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/6fcb9fa), [b049ddb](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/b049ddb))
- **Update-first nudge on Feedback**: a soft, non-blocking callout links to the Updates tab when the deployment is behind. ([edd2240](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/edd2240))
- **Version badge and changelog link in Setup**: the bot identity step shows the running version (amber when an update is available) alongside a link to the changelog. ([c2898cb](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/c2898cb))
- **Bulk-delegate Tasks to a chosen Lead**: the board's bulk-select now includes a Lead picker, queuing the selected cards as autonomous runs under that Lead (or auto-routed). ([0a45c1e](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/0a45c1e))
- **Expand/collapse markdown notes** on every Kanban card, not just done cards, for long or multi-line notes. ([1697319](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/1697319))
- **Markdown link rendering** (`[text](url)`) in the panel Markdown component, and a local `GET /api/update/changelog` route. ([b049ddb](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/b049ddb))

### Improved
- **Agent chat resume token** now persists per-agent to `agentChat.json`, so a panel chat with a Lead survives a restart instead of starting cold. ([b1703f2](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/b1703f2))
- **Planning/Execution toggle** remembers its last state per agent in localStorage instead of resetting to Execution on every mount. ([0025d0c](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/0025d0c))
- Documented that each Lead bot's session already survives restarts and updates (resume token in `data/lead-<id>-state.json`, untouched by `update.sh`). ([803b15e](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/803b15e))

## [0.5.3] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- **Planning mode for Lead chat**: the Execution/Planning toggle now works in every Lead/worker panel chat session, not just Atlas. Leads stay conversational and propose backlog cards instead of taking real actions. ([c5c26d1](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/c5c26d1), [d910ced](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/d910ced))
- **Inbox "Run as one task" bulk action**: select multiple suggestions and delegate them as a single merged task. ([be39693](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/be39693))
- **Inbox multi-select** with bulk park / delegate / dismiss and delegate-as-Lead. ([7b1cd95](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/7b1cd95))
- **Embeddings probe chip**: panel now shows which embedding backend is live and lets you manually override auto-probe mode. ([2af6d17](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/2af6d17))
- **Markdown card notes** in Tasks, Lucide icon set across nav, chat role labels, Crew role chips. ([d910ced](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/d910ced), [1ca66e0](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/1ca66e0))
- **Semantic colour tokens** for the Logs activity feed and memory tier indicators. ([69455c8](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/69455c8))

### Improved
- **`auto_until_error` escalation state** is now persisted across restarts. ([7b98dc8](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/7b98dc8))
- **Schedules**: busy-chat fallback behaviour improved, errors surfaced in the panel. ([ee8028e](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/ee8028e))
- **Panel bundle split**: main chunk down from 647 kB to 250 kB (roughly 61% smaller) via `React.lazy` for 20 tabs and separate vendor chunks for React, Lucide, and xterm. ([731ebd7](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/731ebd7))

### Fixed
- Loopback addresses now exempt from panel auth lockout. ([6ba3ea3](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/6ba3ea3))
- Keyboard navigation for clickable Task cards. ([cf7f5fa](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/cf7f5fa))
- Workers wizard "Done" button missing i18n string. ([bb2c418](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/bb2c418))
- Stale agent chat empty-state copy (claimed sessions were stateless when they are not). ([5de9df2](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/5de9df2))

## [0.5.2] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- **Agent identity + diff rendering** in panel agent chat: tool calls show which agent ran them and a mini diff for file edits. ([86fd81c](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/86fd81c))
- **Web Chat badge** on Crew/Agents cards: one click opens a panel chat session with that Lead. ([34d8580](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/34d8580))
- **Command palette** (Cmd+K / Ctrl+K): keyboard-first navigation across all panel views. ([067e13a](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/067e13a))
- **Mobile UX pass**: searchable More drawer, bottom nav, Kanban scroll-snap, Health status strip, Chat FAB. ([64dd8c4](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/64dd8c4))
- **3-tier nav, Command Hub, unified Settings**: desktop sidebar reorganised into three groups; chat and terminal share a hub. ([e541b97](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/e541b97))

### Improved
- Default `PANEL_RATE_LIMIT` raised from 30 to 120 req/min. ([12a4dd2](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/12a4dd2))
- Delegation log secrets redacted; hot-tier memory hardened against injection. ([1bf53f5](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/1bf53f5))

([90db310](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/90db310), [192efb6](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/192efb6), [c8facad](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/c8facad), [7f931db](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/7f931db))

## [0.1.0] - 2026-06-24

Initial release. A Telegram bot driving the Claude Agent SDK on the host machine, with streamed replies, inline tool-approval buttons, and an allowed-user allow-list.
