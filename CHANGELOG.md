## [0.6.0] - 2026-07-01

### Added
- **Image generation connectors**: text-to-image via Replicate, fal.ai, or a local Automatic1111 endpoint, wired as an `imageGen` MCP surface available to both delegated task runs and Lead bots. Generated images land in a persistent gallery with a dedicated panel Gallery view, and the providers get their own connector cards, icons, and en/hu i18n. ([7e35933](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/7e35933))
- **Jira Cloud and Linear connectors**: two new issue-tracker integrations. Jira via REST v3 (`email:api-token@site` auth): list projects, JQL search, read issue, list/apply transitions, create, comment. Linear via GraphQL: list teams/projects/states, search and read issues, create, move state, comment. Both live, scope-gated, vault-backed, with brand icons, help copy, and en/hu i18n. ([e43c7a8](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/e43c7a8))
- **Audit log viewer and anomaly detection**: the append-only action audit log is now a searchable panel view (filter by actor, resource, and action, with NDJSON export), folded in as a 4th tab of the Logs view. A deterministic anomaly detector scans the recent log for suspicious patterns (delete bursts, vault access outside working hours, new privileged grants) and raises findings through the heartbeat/Telegram alert path, configurable as an `anomaly` heartbeat signal. Routes: `GET /api/audit/search`, `/api/audit/facets`, `/api/audit/anomalies`. ([83b0600](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/83b0600), [e0f76c0](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/e0f76c0))
- **Skill export/import bundles**: per-skill Export downloads a versioned `myhq.skill` JSON bundle (name, description, prompt, cwd); Import validates an untrusted bundle and installs it as a new skill, de-duping name collisions with an " (imported)" suffix. Routes: `GET /api/skills/:id/export`, `POST /api/skills/import`, audited, with en/hu i18n. ([5ede569](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/5ede569))
- **`/ping` and `/team` commands**: `/ping` (Atlas and every Lead) answers "am I online?" instantly with idle/busy state, the current task, elapsed time, and process uptime. `/team` (Atlas) lists each Lead's live Telegram connection (online/offline) and busy/idle state, so users can see the crew's status instead of asking. ([58a80cd](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/58a80cd))
- **Manual Lead restart route**: `POST /api/workers/:id/restart-bot` forces a Lead's Telegram instance to restart on demand, for diagnosing a report without waiting on the 60s watchdog tick. ([f93c286](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/f93c286))

### Fixed
- **Lead bots stopped reading messages while working**: a Lead's message handlers awaited the entire turn, which blocks Telegraf's poll loop (it awaits each update batch before fetching the next) and, with `handlerTimeout: Infinity`, never released, so new messages sat unfetched until the turn ended. Turns now dispatch fire-and-forget so polling stays live and the busy guard can answer follow-ups. ([58a80cd](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/58a80cd))
- **Busy-notice reliability**: a failed "still busy" send could reject into the turn-lifecycle catch and clear the *running* turn's busy flag; busy notices are now fully fire-and-forget. Lead stale-session recovery no longer re-enters while still busy (which left the session stuck busy forever and leaked the typing interval). Busy notices now rotate their wording and always report the current task, elapsed time, and `/stop` + `/ping` hints. ([58a80cd](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/58a80cd))
- **Lead bots auto-restart after a silent poll death**: a Lead's Telegraf `launch()` can end on its own (most notably a 409 Conflict from a second poller on the same token) without the registry changing, leaving the entry lingering offline. `LeadBot` now tracks `isRunning()` and a 60s `LeadBotManager` watchdog treats a dead entry like a missing one and revives it. ([59e8d91](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/59e8d91), [f93c286](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/f93c286))
- **Main bot self-heals its Telegram polling**: instead of exiting on a 409 Conflict, the bot tries a few in-process relaunches with backoff (409s often self-resolve in seconds) before falling back to a full restart routed through graceful shutdown (drains in-flight turns, flushes sessions) with a nonzero exit so the service manager still restarts it. ([95da9d1](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/95da9d1))
- **`crew_set_bot_photo` rejected valid avatars**: telegraf 4.16.3's multipart builder silently dropped the profile-photo attachment, so Telegram returned "photo isn't specified" even with a valid PNG. Replaced with a direct native `fetch` + `FormData` request against the bot token, surfacing Telegram's rejection reason in the log. ([dcf01fb](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/dcf01fb))
- **Stale panel artifacts on dev start**: `npm run dev` could serve leftover `panel/dist` chunks from a previous session because `vite build --watch` never re-empties the output dir. A `predev` hook now runs a clean `build:panel` before the watchers and bot start. ([a7c0e73](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/a7c0e73))
- **Oversized Sign Out button**: the sidebar Sign Out button used larger spacing/text than its sibling nav items; normalized to match, and dropped two remaining hardcoded `text-[10px]` badges. ([6b7afb7](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/6b7afb7))

## [0.5.9] - 2026-07-01

### Added
- **Reusable prompt template library**: templates with `{{variable}}` slots, saved in `templates.json` with full CRUD REST routes, surfaced as a panel management view, a chat composer quick-pick, and a `/templates` Telegram command. ([4bb1ada](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/4bb1ada))
- **Memory portable export/import**: `GET /api/memories/export` (embeddings stripped) and `POST /api/memories/import` merge an exported dump, deduping by normalized text and passing the hot tier through the injection guard. Export/Import buttons added to the Memory panel. ([0cc525e](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/0cc525e))
- **Telegram inline-mode search**: an `inline_query` handler ranks the operator's own cards, skills, and memories with the shared hybrid `semanticSearch` and pastes the chosen item as a plain-text snippet; gated on the user-id allow-list directly since inline queries carry no chat context. ([d920325](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/d920325))
- **Connector token expiry tracking**: an optional OAuth/token expiry per connector with a derived freshness status (ok/expiring/expired, 3-day warn window), surfaced as badges and a datetime-local control in the Connectors panel with re-auth guidance, wired through `PUT /api/connectors/:id`. ([c593c27](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/c593c27))
- **Chat image upload**: attach/drag-drop/paste images (jpeg/png/gif/webp) to Atlas and Lead chats with preview thumbnails, per-image and batch caps, and backend re-validation (magic-byte sniff, size/count limits) riding the existing vision path. ([152e8f7](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/152e8f7))
- **Modern model picker**: a portaled, always-open `ModelSelect` combobox replaces the old datalist across Settings (model + fallback) and Workers (wizard + edit); `claude-fable-5` restored to the suggestion list and Telegram `/model` shortcuts. ([152e8f7](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/152e8f7), [ba8a065](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/ba8a065), [374f828](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/374f828))
- **Model alias map**: retired model IDs (`claude-sonnet-4-5`/`4-6`) are silently upgraded to `claude-sonnet-5` at the SDK call site in `runner.ts`, no restart or manual edit required; all quick-pick/suggestion surfaces and the installer wizard now reference Sonnet 5 directly. ([e3c310b](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/e3c310b), [33a1867](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/33a1867))
- **Per-Lead stream mode**: Lead bots now select their streaming backend (rich/draft/edit) the same STREAM_MODE-aware way Atlas does, with a per-lead override dropdown in the Worker form, instead of always hardcoding the legacy edit streamer. ([95bb4e7](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/95bb4e7), [5e7e168](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/5e7e168), [aadbb31](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/aadbb31))
- **Per-card delegate-to-Lead picker**: task cards show a Lead picker next to "Delegate to agent" whenever more than one Lead is enabled, instead of only supporting per-lead choice from the bulk-select toolbar. ([bd3c5b6](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/bd3c5b6))
- **Panel UX/a11y polish pass**: standardized `Skeleton` loading states across Prompt/Heartbeat/RemoteAccess/Templates; a shared `errorMessage()` i18n mapping rolled out across ~20 views; a globally reachable keyboard shortcuts modal; a 4th selectable high-contrast theme; a `clamp()`-based fluid typography scale; extracted xterm theme fallbacks into `lib/themeColors.ts`. ([ea6908c](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/ea6908c))

### Fixed
- **Lead/worker identity leak**: Lead and worker agents identified as "Atlas" in panel chat and autonomous runs because the Lead protocol block was appended after the fixed Atlas personality opener. A new `workerIdentity` param now replaces the opening identity block entirely for Leads. ([b5d2173](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/b5d2173))
- **Stale session auto-recovery**: when the Claude CLI rejects a resume token with "No conversation found," `bot.ts`, `leadBot.ts`, and `agentChat.ts` now detect it via a shared `isStaleSession()` helper, drop the stored token, notify the user, and automatically re-run the same prompt as a fresh turn, no manual `/new` required. ([34e8b29](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/34e8b29))
- **Startup resilience**: a transient `ECONNRESET` on Telegram `getMe()`/`setMyCommands()` at boot no longer kills the process (retry with backoff added); `npm run dev`'s watcher now auto-restarts the bot on crash, not just on file changes. ([60b83f5](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/60b83f5))
- **Overflowing role/portfolio badges**: long portfolio strings (e.g. "Web design, UI, and illustration Lead") no longer overflow cards or push layout elements off-screen — truncation with hover tooltips applied across Crew node cards, Chat profile cards and bubbles, and the agent switcher/chat header. ([7831bce](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/7831bce), [708b009](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/708b009), [fb0fe8a](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/fb0fe8a), [aadbb31](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/aadbb31))
- **Sidebar overflow at high resolution**: hard `2xl:` breakpoint overrides stacked on top of the fluid `clamp()` type scale made nav rows too tall to fit the viewport on wide high-res displays, forcing scroll. Overrides removed; sidebar widens at `2xl` instead, and nav items compact below `2xl` on lower resolutions. ([bd3c5b6](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/bd3c5b6), [1c48be8](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/1c48be8))
- **Model dropdown invisible / stuck on picked value**: `ModelSelect`'s options list, positioned `absolute`, was clipped by any ancestor with `overflow-hidden` (e.g. the Settings accordion) — now rendered via a `document.body` portal at a computed fixed position. Separately, picking a value made the list look "stuck" on that one match because the filter ran against the committed value; decoupled via an `editing` flag, plus a clear "×" button. Local providers no longer show the 4 hardcoded Anthropic suggestions. ([ba8a065](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/ba8a065), [374f828](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/374f828))
- **StatusStrip covering page content**: the global "what's running" strip covered the footer/content on every non-Chat page and popped in jerkily. Its height is now reserved at the shared `<main>` layout level (not just on Chat) with a smooth opacity/translate-y transition, staying briefly mounted instead of hard-unmounting. ([d63378b](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/d63378b))
- **Untranslated connector copy + invisible monochrome icons**: the connector info modal's summary, credential label, setup steps, and tool labels were hardcoded English regardless of panel language; restructured into a shape manifest resolved via `t()` (en/hu), and the card grid's summary/credential hint reuse the same keys. Monochrome brand icons (Notion, GitHub, Apple Calendar/Mail, Unity, Unreal, SQLite) now render via `currentColor` so they stay visible on the Matrix and light themes. ([09faa9d](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/09faa9d), [e7bd477](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/e7bd477))
- **Misc panel fixes**: duplicate floating "?" shortcuts button removed (the header "?" already opens the same modal); agent-chat tool-use now attributed to the correct agent in the Activity feed instead of showing unattributed; the transcript diff viewer's show/hide toggle is now translated (en/hu). ([3ac608b](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/3ac608b), [8ef6cb1](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/8ef6cb1), [395561c](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/395561c))

## [0.5.8] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- **PostgreSQL and SQLite database connectors**: two new live integrations (connectors 9 and 10). Each exposes `list_tables`, `describe_schema`, and a read-only `query` tool (SELECT/WITH only, guarded by `assertReadOnlySql`), plus a write-scoped `execute` tool gated behind `WRITE_TOOLS`. PostgreSQL uses a lazily-loaded `pg` client from a connection-string credential; SQLite uses Node's built-in `node:sqlite` opened read-only. ([9a3e884](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/9a3e884))
- **Unreal Engine MCP connector**: connects to the official Epic UE 5.8 MCP plugin running in the local editor via SSE at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/mcp`. No credential required to activate; an optional vault URL can override the default endpoint. ([42b8a52](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/42b8a52))
- **Unity MCP connector**: targets the `mcp-unity` package (CoderGamester) via stdio transport. The credential is the path to the server script inside the Unity project's package cache; the SDK spawns the Node.js server as a child process per turn. ([1fe87b7](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/1fe87b7))
- **Connector brand icons**: `simple-icons` v16 added to the panel; each connector card header now shows a 20px brand SVG that reveals its brand hex colour on hover. ([0d1864f](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/0d1864f))
- **Connector info modal**: each connector card has a help button that opens a modal with a plain-English description, credential format, numbered setup steps, colour-coded tool badges (read = green, write = amber), and a contextual tip. ([3dc9979](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/3dc9979))
- **Keyboard shortcuts card**: a collapsible card at the bottom of the System (Health) panel view lists all panel-wide keyboard shortcuts (Cmd+K palette, Esc, arrows, Enter/Shift+Enter in chat). ([e06bffd](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/e06bffd))
- **Default Paths (known paths)**: a new Settings panel section for named folder shortcuts (`{ label, path }` pairs). These are injected into the system prompt every turn so agents know key directories without being told each time, and appear as quick-pick chips in the Workers panel when setting a worker `cwd`. Persisted in `mainAgent.json`; settable via `PUT /api/agent` with `knownPaths`. ([e9b65cf](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/e9b65cf), [81003fe](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/81003fe), [163d427](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/163d427))
- **Playbook size warning**: the panel warns when `work.md` or `CLAUDE.md` in the active session directory grows beyond a size threshold (both are injected into the system prompt on every turn) and offers a one-click trim for `work.md`. ([843195b](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/843195b))
- **macOS installer Xcode licence preflight**: before running Homebrew, the installer now checks whether the Xcode licence has been accepted and offers to accept it automatically, preventing silent mid-install failures when the full Xcode.app is the selected developer dir. ([086d105](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/086d105))

### Fixed
- **`knownPaths` not persisted**: the backend was silently dropping the `knownPaths` field from `PUT /api/agent` — it was never destructured or passed to `setMainSettings()`, so saves returned 200 but persisted nothing. ([163d427](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/163d427))
- **Unified `WORKDIR` default to `~/MyHQ-Workspace`**: the agent working directory now defaults to `~/MyHQ-Workspace` across all platforms, auto-created on first run. The Windows installer previously defaulted the WORKDIR prompt to `<InstallDir>\data`, conflating it with the bot's internal state storage. `.env.example` updated to document the default. ([ab9e6f4](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/ab9e6f4), [be705b1](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/be705b1))
- **Update output placement**: in-panel update progress output is now rendered inside the top status card directly under the Apply button, instead of a separate card at the bottom of the Updates view where it wasn't immediately visible. ([f11cb17](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/f11cb17))
- **Installer sudo prompt clarity**: the first time the installer elevates to sudo, it now prints a clear notice that the password field shows nothing on screen. ([29363f0](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/29363f0))

### Changed
- **Em dash cleanup**: replaced all em dashes used as prose connectors in user-facing strings (panel and Telegram i18n files, `work.md`) with context-appropriate punctuation — commas, colons, periods, or parentheses. Code comments, UI placeholders (`— none —`), and numeric ranges are unchanged. ([8cb54b0](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/8cb54b0))

## [0.5.7] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- **Slack and GitHub connectors**: two new live integrations alongside the existing six. Slack (`slack_list_channels`/`history`/`post_message`/`reply_thread`/`search`/`upload_file`) and GitHub (`github_list_repos`/`list_issues`/`get_file`/`put_file`/`create_issue`/`comment_issue`/`create_pr`), each vault-backed with a read/write scope toggle. ([fd5b24a](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/fd5b24a))
- **Generic outbound webhook connector**: register an arbitrary HTTP endpoint in the panel (Webhook Tools view) and it surfaces to the agent as a callable `webhook_<slug>` MCP tool. Each request goes through the SSRF-guarded `safeFetch`, and an auth header can reference a `vault:<id>` secret so tokens never sit in plaintext. Routes: `GET|POST /api/webhook-tools`, `PUT|DELETE /api/webhook-tools/:id`. ([eb005ef](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/eb005ef))
- **Event-driven inbound webhook triggers**: external services hit a public per-trigger URL (`POST /hook/:id`, authenticated by HMAC-SHA256 over the raw body with the trigger's own secret) to kick off an autonomous run. A fired trigger files a backlog card and delegates it, reusing the full delegation path (transcript, retry, completion webhook); the inbound payload is appended to the prompt. Managed via `GET|POST /api/webhook-triggers`, `PUT|DELETE /api/webhook-triggers/:id`, `POST /api/webhook-triggers/:id/rotate`, `GET /api/webhook-triggers/:id/secret`. ([c5e0888](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/c5e0888))
- **`/digest` command**: a tight Telegram summary of the last 24h of fleet activity — tasks completed, autonomous runs ok/errored, memories written, skills saved, and cost. ([73b81a9](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/73b81a9))
- **Conversation search across sessions**: one panel search box over the live chat history and every on-disk run transcript, ranked by the shared hybrid (cosine + keyword) search with snippet extraction. Route: `GET /api/conversations/search`. ([8f0f69a](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/8f0f69a))
- **Relevance-weighted council votes + configurable quorum**: each voter's weight is the proposal's relevance to their domain (1.0 when embeddings are off, so everyone counts equally), and the decision rule is configurable — `majority` (default), `supermajority` (≥2/3 of decisive weight), or `unanimous`. Routes: `GET|PUT /api/council/rule`. ([7368840](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/7368840))
- **White-label branding** (gated licensed feature): a panel surface to override product/agent name, panel title, logo, favicon, colours, and email footer. The configuration always exists and persists, but overrides are only *applied* when `BRANDING_UNLOCKED=true` (free for self-hosters; there is deliberately no panel toggle). Routes: `GET|PUT /api/branding`. ([d1aacbd](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/d1aacbd))
- **Multi-device presence**: a panel banner showing when the dashboard is open on more than one device, broadcast over the existing WebSocket. ([fb4bfcb](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/fb4bfcb))
- **Onboarding CTA for unconfigured connectors**: the Connectors view shows the full catalogue with credential hints when nothing is set up yet. ([f7ca4b2](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/f7ca4b2), [5cffceb](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/5cffceb))

### Fixed
- **Stuck-task recovery**: a `POST /api/tasks/:id/unstick` route aborts any live run, drops the card from the queue, and clears its delegation without re-running it; cards left `queued`/`running` by a restart are auto-reconciled to a retryable error on boot. Plus an agents empty-state CTA, Linux OAuth keyring support for the usage probe, and a `work.md` drift indicator with a restore-to-default action (`POST /api/prompt/restore`). ([0890a30](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/0890a30))

## [0.5.6] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- **Recurring Kanban card templates**: mark a card as a recurring template (daily/weekly/monthly cadence) and a fresh backlog copy spawns on schedule; the template stays put and copies don't carry the recurrence. A 60s ticker fires due templates regardless of the panel, and live-refreshes the board over the WebSocket when it does. ([20be716](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/20be716))
- **Live "What's running" status strip**: a panel strip that surfaces the currently active agent runs at a glance. ([59d947e](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/59d947e))
- **Thumbs up/down reactions on assistant messages**: react to a panel-chat reply; a thumbs-up files the response as a durable memory. Backed by `POST /api/chat/react`. ([9462712](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/9462712))
- **Memory tag filtering + bulk-delete mode**: filter the Memory view by tag and multi-select entries for bulk deletion. ([af8ad13](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/af8ad13))
- **Vault search filter + copy-to-clipboard** on the Vault view. ([7a3d046](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/7a3d046))
- **Wizard-first agent menu**: the Workers/agent menu leads with the guided wizard, with a collapsible memory tag list. ([6ab87f4](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/6ab87f4))

### Improved
- **Workers UX**: renamed the create buttons Wizard→Easy and Manual→Advanced, reordered them, pre-filled the Advanced worker `cwd` with the host home directory plus a platform-aware path hint, and added inline form/wizard hints. ([63c845d](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/63c845d), [b2eb1f9](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/b2eb1f9), [36972cc](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/36972cc))
- **Reusable UI primitives**: added `Modal`, `Popover`, and `ConfirmDialog` to `ui.tsx`, and adopted styled confirm dialogs plus a run-agent model badge across the panel. ([6c45608](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/6c45608), [0b972f0](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/0b972f0))
- **Finer memory salience control**: a more precise slider with a numeric input. ([111facb](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/111facb))
- **Updates badge**: a `CheckCircle2` icon on the up-to-date state. ([c1529e0](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/c1529e0))

### Fixed
- **Draft keepalive vs. `crew_ask_president`**: the draft streamer's keepalive now pauses while a `crew_ask_president` call is awaiting the user, so the pending question isn't clobbered. ([204fe09](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/204fe09))

### Security
- **Crash-atomic vault key rotation**: a write-ahead journal makes `rotateKey()` recoverable if the process dies mid-rotation, so secrets can't be left half-re-encrypted. ([c3b611b](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/c3b611b))
- **Wider vault secret-id entropy**: secret ids widened from 32-bit to 64-bit to make them unguessable. ([a5fce6a](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/a5fce6a))
- **Separate ceiling on expensive GET reads**: new `PANEL_READ_RATE_LIMIT` (default 600/window) caps the few heavy read endpoints (memory semantic search, log reads/search, run transcripts) so a runaway client can't flood them, without throttling normal fleet activity. ([be86cdc](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/be86cdc))
- **Loud terminal env warning**: when `PANEL_TERMINAL_INHERIT_ENV=true` exposes the full host environment to the panel shell, the bot now logs a loud warning and DMs allowed users. ([6ee3831](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/6ee3831))

## [0.5.5] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- **Agent avatars**: pick an avatar from a curated set (13 flat-illustration assets) for any worker/Lead; avatars show on Crew/Workers cards and in chat bubbles, and each Lead bot's Telegram profile photo is set automatically on startup. ([a9367b4](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/a9367b4), [187b7bc](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/187b7bc), [569a097](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/569a097), [db6df2e](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/db6df2e))
- **Run Agent modal**: the worker cards' Run Agent button opens a confirmation modal with the agent name, role, working directory, and a one-shot editable prompt (prefilled, never mutating the saved worker). ([13c822d](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/13c822d))
- **Autonomy level selector in Chat**: choose supervised/standard/full per panel chat from the toolbar, replacing the removed `PANEL_CHAT_BYPASS` env flag. ([5f98335](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/5f98335), [6bec138](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/6bec138))
- **Interactive AskUserQuestion widgets** in panel chat, backed by `GET /api/asks` and `POST /api/asks/resolve`. ([78b7f7b](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/78b7f7b))
- **Chat permissions indicator** with browser-resolvable approvals. ([abac35c](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/abac35c))
- **PLANNING badge** shown in chat instead of the raw planning preamble. ([cd80443](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/cd80443))

### Security
- **`crew_delegate` privilege-escalation fix**: the delegated child run's autonomy is now capped at the caller's (only `full`/`auto_until_error` callers grant bypass), and a planning turn files the delegation to the suggestion inbox for explicit approval instead of firing real work. ([26f929c](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/26f929c))

## [0.5.4] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- **Semantic search for tasks and skills**: new `task_search` and `skill_search` MCP tools (auto-allowed) let agents find existing cards and skills by meaning before creating duplicates, via a shared cosine + keyword blend with keyword-only fallback when embeddings are off. ([75c0a08](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/75c0a08))
- **In-panel changelog viewer**: the Updates view fetches the public CHANGELOG, shows a collapsible "What's new" section for releases newer than the installed version, a year-grouped Release history, and falls back to the locally served changelog when GitHub is unreachable. ([edd2240](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/edd2240), [6fcb9fa](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/6fcb9fa), [b049ddb](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/b049ddb))
- **Update-first nudge on Feedback**: a soft, non-blocking callout links to the Updates tab when the deployment is behind. ([edd2240](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/edd2240))
- **Version badge and changelog link in Setup**: the bot identity step shows the running version (amber when an update is available) alongside a link to the changelog. ([c2898cb](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/c2898cb))
- **Bulk-delegate Tasks to a chosen Lead**: the board's bulk-select now includes a Lead picker, queuing the selected cards as autonomous runs under that Lead (or auto-routed). ([0a45c1e](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/0a45c1e))
- **Expand/collapse markdown notes** on every Kanban card, not just done cards, for long or multi-line notes. ([1697319](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/1697319))
- **Markdown link rendering** (`[text](url)`) in the panel Markdown component, and a local `GET /api/update/changelog` route. ([b049ddb](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/b049ddb))

### Improved
- **Agent chat resume token** now persists per-agent to `agentChat.json`, so a panel chat with a Lead survives a restart instead of starting cold. ([b1703f2](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/b1703f2))
- **Planning/Execution toggle** remembers its last state per agent in localStorage instead of resetting to Execution on every mount. ([0025d0c](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/0025d0c))
- Documented that each Lead bot's session already survives restarts and updates (resume token in `data/lead-<id>-state.json`, untouched by `update.sh`). ([803b15e](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/803b15e))

## [0.5.3] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- **Planning mode for Lead chat**: the Execution/Planning toggle now works in every Lead/worker panel chat session, not just Atlas. Leads stay conversational and propose backlog cards instead of taking real actions. ([c5c26d1](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/c5c26d1), [d910ced](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/d910ced))
- **Inbox "Run as one task" bulk action**: select multiple suggestions and delegate them as a single merged task. ([be39693](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/be39693))
- **Inbox multi-select** with bulk park / delegate / dismiss and delegate-as-Lead. ([7b1cd95](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/7b1cd95))
- **Embeddings probe chip**: panel now shows which embedding backend is live and lets you manually override auto-probe mode. ([2af6d17](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/2af6d17))
- **Markdown card notes** in Tasks, Lucide icon set across nav, chat role labels, Crew role chips. ([d910ced](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/d910ced), [1ca66e0](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/1ca66e0))
- **Semantic colour tokens** for the Logs activity feed and memory tier indicators. ([69455c8](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/69455c8))

### Improved
- **`auto_until_error` escalation state** is now persisted across restarts. ([7b98dc8](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/7b98dc8))
- **Schedules**: busy-chat fallback behaviour improved, errors surfaced in the panel. ([ee8028e](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/ee8028e))
- **Panel bundle split**: main chunk down from 647 kB to 250 kB (roughly 61% smaller) via `React.lazy` for 20 tabs and separate vendor chunks for React, Lucide, and xterm. ([731ebd7](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/731ebd7))

### Fixed
- Loopback addresses now exempt from panel auth lockout. ([6ba3ea3](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/6ba3ea3))
- Keyboard navigation for clickable Task cards. ([cf7f5fa](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/cf7f5fa))
- Workers wizard "Done" button missing i18n string. ([bb2c418](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/bb2c418))
- Stale agent chat empty-state copy (claimed sessions were stateless when they are not). ([5de9df2](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/5de9df2))

## [0.5.2] - 2026-06-29

### Added
- **Agent identity + diff rendering** in panel agent chat: tool calls show which agent ran them and a mini diff for file edits. ([86fd81c](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/86fd81c))
- **Web Chat badge** on Crew/Agents cards: one click opens a panel chat session with that Lead. ([34d8580](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/34d8580))
- **Command palette** (Cmd+K / Ctrl+K): keyboard-first navigation across all panel views. ([067e13a](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/067e13a))
- **Mobile UX pass**: searchable More drawer, bottom nav, Kanban scroll-snap, Health status strip, Chat FAB. ([64dd8c4](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/64dd8c4))
- **3-tier nav, Command Hub, unified Settings**: desktop sidebar reorganised into three groups; chat and terminal share a hub. ([e541b97](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/e541b97))

### Improved
- Default `PANEL_RATE_LIMIT` raised from 30 to 120 req/min. ([12a4dd2](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/12a4dd2))
- Delegation log secrets redacted; hot-tier memory hardened against injection. ([1bf53f5](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/1bf53f5))
- Schedule prompts capped/sanitised; mutating API routes rate-limited. ([1747a31](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/1747a31))

### Fixed
- Multiple nav categorisation and icon alignment fixes across desktop and mobile sidebar. ([90db310](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/90db310), [192efb6](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/192efb6), [c8facad](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/c8facad), [7f931db](https://github.com/gyorgysh/myhq/commit/7f931db))
