/**
 * Built-in Anthropic model suggestions shown in every model picker in the panel
 * (main agent settings, worker editor, add-agent wizard). These are convenience
 * defaults only — any model id can still be typed by hand, and provider-backed
 * pickers merge in models fetched live from the provider.
 *
 * Keep this list in sync with the Telegram bot's MODEL_SHORTCUTS in
 * src/commands.ts so both surfaces offer the same quick picks.
