# CCT Panel · claude-code-telegram

**A self-hosted AI operator for your machines.** Reach it from your phone over Telegram, or from a browser through the CCT Panel: a web dashboard with live system health, sub-agents, a task board, durable memory, and an encrypted secret vault, all served by the same process.

![CCT Panel — Agents view](images/ft_agents.webp)

Open source. It puts a real **Claude Code** agent on your machine and lets you drive it in plain language: check on services, restart things, read logs, edit a crontab, ship code — with replies streaming back live and every risky action gated behind your approval.

It has grown well past a chat bot. The same agent you talk to over Telegram powers named **sub-agents** that run on a schedule or on demand, a **task board** whose cards you can delegate to an autonomous run, and a **memory** that recalls the relevant facts into every conversation so it adapts to you over time. It runs on cloud models (Opus / Sonnet / Haiku) *or* your own local LLMs (LM Studio, Ollama), switchable live from the panel.

> ⚠️ **This can read, write, and run commands on the machine it runs on.** Access is gated only by a Telegram user-id allow-list (and, for the panel, a secret token). Keep `ALLOWED_USER_IDS` tight and run it somewhere you control.

## Two ways in

The same agent, two front doors:

- **Telegram**: message a bot from your phone. The old loop for touching a server (open a terminal, SSH in, run something, close) becomes a chat with something already living on the server that knows the system. When a service falls over at 2 am you get a ping and fix it from the couch, no SSH client required.
- **CCT Panel**: an optional web dashboard served by the same process. Chat with the agent in the browser, watch live system health and backend status, run and schedule sub-agents, delegate task-board cards, browse memory and skills, manage secrets, and tune proactive monitoring.

## CCT Panel — the web dashboard

| --- | --- |
| ![Agents panel — configure the main agent and sub-agent workers](images/ft_agents_small.webp) | ![Tasks panel — Kanban board with delegate-to-agent](images/ft_tasks.webp) |
| **Agents**: switch the main agent's model live; create named **workers** with their own model, persona, skill, and optional schedule — runs are concurrent and stream output live. | **Tasks**: a Kanban board (Backlog / In progress / Done) with drag-and-drop, priority, WIP limits, and a **Delegate** button that hands a card to an autonomous agent run. |
| ![Heartbeat panel — proactive monitoring](images/ft_heartbeat.webp) | ![Schedules panel — timed autonomous prompts](images/ft_schedulers.webp) |
| **Heartbeat**: proactive monitoring. Set CPU/mem/swap/disk thresholds and a stalled-card window; the bot pings Telegram on breach, or runs an autonomous turn to investigate and act first. | **Schedules**: create timed autonomous prompts (`30m`, `2h`, `HH:MM`) from the panel or via `/schedule` in chat — results push back to Telegram. |

Also inside: **System** (live CPU per-core, memory, swap, disk I/O), **Status** (Claude service status + provider/local-backend probes), **Memory** (browse / search / edit), **Vault** (AES-256-GCM secrets), **Skills**, **Prompt** (playbook editor), **Logs** (live tail), and more.

## In Telegram

| ![Upload a file, Claude sees it and approves a Bash call](images/tg-claude-1.webp) | ![Reply streaming live as it's written](images/tg-claude-2.webp) |
| Upload files and photos — Claude *sees* images inline. Here it approves a `Bash` call directly from the chat. | Replies stream back live as they're written using Telegram's Rich Messages API, then land as a clean, formatted message. |
| ![Inline approve / deny / always-allow buttons](images/tg-claude-4.webp) | ![A tool call paused for approval](images/tg-claude-3.webp) |
| Tap **✅ Approve**, **❌ Deny**, or **♾️ Always allow** — the last option whitelists the tool for the rest of the session. | Every non-read-only tool call pauses the run and posts the exact command for review. |

## Quick install

On a fresh **Linux** or **macOS** machine, the wizard installs everything (Homebrew on macOS, Node 20+, git, and the Claude Code CLI), checks RAM, clones the repo, builds it, walks you through `.env`, optionally sets up voice transcription, and offers to run as a background service:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://gyorgy.sh/cct-install.sh | bash
```

You'll need a [bot token](#setup) and your numeric Telegram user id on hand — the wizard prompts for both. Prefer to read before you run? The script is [`scripts/cct-install.sh`](scripts/cct-install.sh).

> The wizard is interactive and reads your answers from the terminal even when piped through `curl`. For an unattended run, set `CCT_TOKEN`, `CCT_USER_IDS`, and `CCT_MODE=service|manual` (and `CCT_YES=1`) in the environment.

## Setup (manual)

> This is the advanced path: no background services or OS-level workers are installed. That's fine for testing and running the bot in your terminal — full functionality is available. You can always install it as a service later, or uninstall cleanly, without touching your checkout or data.

1. **Create a bot**: message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), run `/newbot`, copy the token.
2. **Find your user id**: message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot).
3. **Configure**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # edit .env: TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, ALLOWED_USER_IDS, WORKDIR
   ```
4. **Install & run**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev         # watch mode (reloads on change)
   # or: npm run build && npm start
   ```

## Run as a service (Linux & macOS)

```bash
./scripts/install-service.sh        # builds, installs + starts the service
./scripts/agentctl.sh status        # start | stop | restart | status | logs
./scripts/agentctl.sh logs          # follow logs
```

- **Linux**: a systemd unit (`telegram-agent`). The installer adds a scoped, passwordless sudoers rule for this service.
- **macOS**: a per-user LaunchAgent (`sh.gyorgy.telegram-agent`) that runs in your login session (where the `claude` CLI login lives); no sudo needed.

You can also **ask the agent to restart itself** ("restart yourself" → `./scripts/agentctl.sh restart`).

### Update & uninstall

```bash
./scripts/update.sh                 # git pull + npm install + build, restarts if a service is installed
./scripts/uninstall-service.sh      # remove the service (leaves the checkout, .env and data/ intact)
```

```
scripts/
  cct-install.sh         # one-liner bootstrap wizard (curl | bash)
  run.sh                 # launcher (build if needed, then run)
  update.sh              # pull + rebuild + restart
  install-service.sh     # installer    -> dispatches by OS
  uninstall-service.sh   # uninstaller  -> dispatches by OS
  agentctl.sh            # manager      -> dispatches by OS
  linux/                 # systemd implementation
  macos/                 # launchd implementation
```

## Configuration

| Variable | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | yes | Token from @BotFather |
| `ALLOWED_USER_IDS` | yes | Comma-separated numeric Telegram user ids (the allow-list) |
| `WORKDIR` | no | Directory Claude starts in (default: `data/`) |
| `STATE_FILE` | no | Session + usage persistence path (default `data/state.json`) |
| `CLAUDE_MODEL` | no | Model id (default `claude-opus-4-8`) |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | no | API key; omit to use `claude` CLI login |
| `APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_MS` | no | Approval wait before auto-deny (default 300000) |
| `STREAM_MODE` | no | `rich` (default), `draft`, or `edit` |
| `TRANSCRIBE_PROVIDER` | no | Voice backend: `openai` (default) or `vosk` (local) |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | no | API key for the `openai` voice backend (OpenAI, Groq, …) |
| `TRANSCRIBE_MODEL` | no | Transcription model (default `whisper-1`) |
| `TRANSCRIBE_BASE_URL` | no | OpenAI-compatible base URL (default `https://api.openai.com/v1`) |
| `VOSK_MODEL_PATH` | no | Path to an unpacked Vosk model dir (enables the `vosk` backend) |
| `FFMPEG_PATH` | no | ffmpeg binary for voice note decoding (default `ffmpeg`) |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | no | `error` \| `warn` \| `info` (default) \| `debug` |
| `WORK_FILE` | no | Path to the operator playbook (default `work.md`) |
| `PANEL_ENABLED` | no | `true` to start the CCT Panel (default `false`) |
| `PANEL_TOKEN` | when panel on | Shared secret for all panel requests; startup fails without it |
| `PANEL_HOST` | no | Bind address (default `127.0.0.1`) |
| `PANEL_PORT` | no | Port (default `8787`) |
| `PANEL_CHAT_ENABLED` | no | `false` to hide the panel Chat view (default `true`) |
| `PANEL_CHAT_BYPASS` | no | `true` to unlock the Chat's auto (no-approval) mode (default `false`) |

### Streaming modes

| Mode | How it streams | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rich` | Bot API 10.1 Rich Messages (`sendRichMessageDraft` → `sendRichMessage`) | Default. Structured formatting. Private chats only. |
| `draft` | Bot API 9.3 `sendMessageDraft` → `sendMessage` | Plain animated preview, finalized as a formatted message. Private chats only. |
| `edit` | Throttled `editMessageText` of a placeholder | Most battle-tested fallback; works in any chat. |

### Voice transcription

Send a voice note and it's transcribed and run like a typed prompt. Two backends via `TRANSCRIBE_PROVIDER`:

- **`openai`** (default): any OpenAI-compatible `/audio/transcriptions` host. Use OpenAI directly, or **Groq's free tier** by setting `TRANSCRIBE_BASE_URL=https://api.groq.com/openai/v1`, `TRANSCRIBE_MODEL=whisper-large-v3-turbo`, and a Groq `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
- **`vosk`**: fully local and offline, no API key needed.
  ```bash
  npm install vosk
  # install ffmpeg, download + unpack a model from https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models
  ```
  Then set `VOSK_MODEL_PATH=/path/to/vosk-model` and `TRANSCRIBE_PROVIDER=vosk`.

## CCT Panel — enabling it

**CCT Panel** is served **in the same process** as the bot (no extra service). Off by default because it has the same reach as the bot.

```bash
PANEL_ENABLED=true
PANEL_TOKEN=choose-a-long-random-secret   # required; startup fails without it
# PANEL_HOST=127.0.0.1
# PANEL_PORT=8787
```

```bash
npm run build && npm start
# dev: npm run dev   (bot + panel rebuild together, never stale)
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8787` and unlock with your `PANEL_TOKEN`. Left-sidebar navigation grouped into **Monitor**, **Operate**, **Configure**, and **Others** — light / dark / hacker themes, URL per view. Keep the bind on loopback and reach it only behind a reverse proxy or private network (e.g. Tailscale).

## Permissions

Nothing runs without your say-so. For every non-read-only tool call you get an inline prompt showing exactly what Claude wants to do:

- **✅ Approve** — run it once.
- **❌ Deny** — refuse it.
- **♾️ Always allow `<Tool>`** — stop asking for that tool for the rest of this session.

To skip prompts entirely, switch a chat to autonomous mode with `/mode auto` (and back with `/mode safe`). Read-only tools (`Read`/`Glob`/`Grep`…) always run automatically.

## Features

- **Live streaming**: uses Telegram's streaming APIs — **Rich Messages** (Bot API 10.1) and **message drafts** (Bot API 9.3) — so replies animate in as a preview and land as cleanly formatted, structured messages.
- **Durable memory**: the agent remembers facts across conversations and recalls the relevant ones into each turn automatically. Distils reusable workflows into the **skills** library on its own.
- **Proactive monitoring**: an optional **heartbeat** watches host health and stalled task cards, pinging Telegram on breach — or running an autonomous turn to investigate first.
- **Secret vault**: AES-256-GCM encrypted secrets with the master key in the macOS Keychain (file fallback on Linux); reference them as `vault:<id>` so tokens never sit in plaintext.
- **Multi-agent platform**: named **workers** run autonomous Claude turns on demand or on a schedule, concurrently, with live streaming output. A **task board** lets you delegate cards to agent runs that can break them into subtasks.
- **Operator playbook (`work.md`)**: define how recurring jobs should be done once and the bot follows your conventions every time. Re-read on every turn, so edits apply without a restart.
- **Session continuity**: context carries across messages; `/new` resets it. Sessions (resume token, cwd, mode, allow-lists, usage) persist to disk across restarts.
- **Git review from chat**: `/diff` shows the diff with inline **Commit / Discard** buttons; `/commit <message>` stages and commits.
- **Voice notes**: transcribed and run as a prompt via an OpenAI-compatible API (OpenAI, Groq) or fully local Vosk.
- **Local model support**: point the main agent or any worker at LM Studio, Ollama, or any proxy with a free-text model name, switchable live from the panel.
- **File send/receive**: upload files/photos (Claude *sees* images inline); Claude can send files back via a built-in `send_file` tool.
- **Quiet by default**: messages from anyone not on the allow-list are silently ignored.

## work.md — your operator playbook

`work.md` is appended to Claude's system prompt on every turn (so edits apply instantly). Use it to define recurring jobs:

- "restart Apache" → the exact command and a config test first
- editing **crontab** safely (diff, back up, non-interactive install)
- deploy steps for your projects
- ground rules (confirm destructive actions, prefer non-interactive commands)

A starter template ships in `work.md`. Point `WORK_FILE` elsewhere to use a different file.

## Commands

| Command | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `/new` | Start a fresh conversation |
| `/cd <path>` | Change working directory |
| `/pwd` | Show current directory |
| `/status` | Show session info (cwd, model, mode, session id) |
| `/projects` | Saved working dirs; switch/add/remove via inline buttons |
| `/diff` | Review the working-tree diff, then commit or discard inline |
| `/commit <message>` | Stage all changes and commit |
| `/usage` | Show cost & activity for this chat (today + lifetime) |
| `/allow <Tool>` · `/allowed` · `/disallow <Tool\|all>` | Manage persistent always-allow rules |
| `/schedule [list]` · `/schedule add <when> \| <prompt>` · `/schedule rm <id>` | Timed autonomous prompts (`when` = `30m`/`2h`/`1d` or `HH:MM`) |
| `/stop` | Abort the running request |
| `/mode safe\|auto` | Interactive approval (default) or autonomous |
| `/help` | Show help |

## Platforms

Runs anywhere Node.js 20+ runs (**Linux**, **macOS**, **Windows**). Authentication for Claude reuses your existing `claude` CLI login, or set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env`. Uses long polling — no public webhook or open port needed.

Built on [`telegraf`](https://github.com/telegraf/telegraf) and [`@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk); the panel uses [`fastify`](https://fastify.dev) + [`systeminformation`](https://systeminformation.io) on the server and React + Vite + Tailwind on the client.

## Support & troubleshooting

- **Bot doesn't respond at all**: confirm your numeric id is in `ALLOWED_USER_IDS`; unknown users are silently ignored. Check logs (raise detail with `LOG_LEVEL=debug`).
- **`npm start` shows stale behavior**: `npm start` runs the compiled `dist/`; rebuild with `npm run build` first.
- **Rich formatting looks off**: try `STREAM_MODE=draft` or `STREAM_MODE=edit`. Rich/draft modes require a private chat.
- **Approvals never resolve**: make sure only one instance is polling — two pollers split updates and cause conflicts.
