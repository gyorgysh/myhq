# MyHQ: Your Personal AI Headquarters

**A self-hosted fleet of autonomous AI agents, deeply integrated with Telegram.** Talk to Atlas, your central coordinator, from your phone. He runs day-to-day operations, remembers everything, learns your workflows, and commands a team of specialized Leads. Each Lead owns a domain and can have its own Telegram bot.

![MyHQ Panel dashboard](images/v01_dashboard.webp)

Open source. Built on real **Claude Code** agents running on your machine, so every agent can read files, run commands, edit code, check services, and ship things. Replies stream back live and risky actions are gated behind your approval.

> **These agents can read, write, and run commands on the machine they run on.** Access is gated by a Telegram user-id allow-list (and, for the panel, a secret token). Keep `ALLOWED_USER_IDS` tight and run it on a machine you control.

## The Command Structure

MyHQ runs a government-style hierarchy. Every agent knows their role and who they report to.

```
You (President)
Atlas  (chief coordinator, runs everything day-to-day)
  Finance Lead     cost tracking, budgets, analytics
  DevOps Lead      infra, deployments, monitoring
  Research Lead    deep dives, reports, synthesis
  ... any Lead you create, each with their own Telegram bot
      Assistant
      Assistant
```

**You** set direction and make final calls. **Atlas** coordinates the team, handles whatever you send him, and knows his Leads' portfolios. **Leads** own their domain. They run specialized autonomous turns, have their own memory and session, and optionally appear as a separate Telegram bot you can message directly. **Assistants** are sub-agents scoped to a Lead.

## Two Ways In

The same agents, two front doors:

**Telegram**: message Atlas from your phone. The old loop for touching a server (open a terminal, SSH in, run something, close it) becomes a chat with something already living on the server that knows your system. When a service falls over at 2 am you get a ping and fix it from the couch, no SSH client required. Your Leads have their own bots, so you can message your DevOps Lead directly without going through Atlas.

**MyHQ Panel**: an optional web dashboard served in the same process. Chat with Atlas in the browser, see your full crew hierarchy, watch live system health, run and schedule agents, delegate task-board cards to autonomous runs, browse memory and skills, manage secrets, and tune proactive monitoring.

## The Panel

| | |
| --- | --- |
| ![Agents panel: Atlas and the crew](images/v01_agents.webp) | ![Tasks panel: Kanban board with delegate-to-agent](images/v01_tasks.webp) |
| **Crew**: see the full org chart (President, Atlas, Leads, Assistants). Delegation log and council vote history are shown here. | **Tasks**: a Kanban board with drag-and-drop, priority, WIP limits, and a Delegate button that hands a card to an autonomous agent run. Columns are fully customizable: rename them or add your own. |
| ![Heartbeat panel: proactive monitoring](images/v01_heartbeat.webp) | ![Schedules panel: timed autonomous prompts](images/v01_scheduler.webp) |
| **Heartbeat**: proactive monitoring. Set CPU/mem/swap/disk thresholds; Atlas pings Telegram on breach, or runs an autonomous turn to investigate and act first. | **Schedules**: create timed autonomous prompts (`30m`, `2h`, `HH:MM`) from the panel or via `/schedule` in chat, with results pushed back to Telegram. |
| ![Memory panel: tier-based fact store](images/v01_memory.webp) | ![Settings: main agent model picker and local model providers](images/v01_llm.webp) |
| **Memory**: a tier-based fact store (hot/warm/cold) that agents write to and recall from automatically, with optional semantic search. Search, edit, promote, demote, and delete entries from the panel. | **Settings**: choose the model and provider for the main agent and every sub-agent, add local model servers (LM Studio, Ollama) or proxies, and tune semantic-memory embeddings. See [Bring Your Own Model](#bring-your-own-model). |

Also inside: **System** (live CPU per-core, memory, swap, disk I/O), **Status** (Claude service status + provider/local-backend probes), **Memory** (tier-based fact store with hot/warm/cold recall plus optional semantic search), **Vault** (AES-256-GCM secrets), **Skills** (reusable workflows), **Prompt** (playbook editor), **Logs** (a human-readable activity feed, raw searchable history with 72h rotation, and usage analytics), **Terminal** (a live shell session in the browser, off by default), **Connectors** (external-service catalogue), **Updates** (check, apply, and roll back versions in place), **Remote Access** (expose the panel over a secure tunnel for phone access), **Settings** (main agent, plan and budget tracker, language, model providers with live local-backend status), and more.

## In Telegram

| | |
| --- | --- |
| ![Atlas creating tasks and running a scheduled briefing from chat](images/v01_mobile_1.webp) | ![Reply streaming live as it's written](images/v01_mobile_2.webp) |
| Just talk to Atlas: he creates task-board cards, runs scheduled briefings, ships commits, and reports back, all from the chat. | Replies stream back live as they're written using Telegram's Rich Messages API, then land as a clean formatted message. |
| ![Inline approve / deny / always-allow buttons](images/v01_mobile_3.webp) | ![Approve and deny outcomes for a paused tool call](images/v01_mobile_5.webp) |
| Every non-read-only tool call pauses and shows exactly what's about to run. Tap **Approve**, **Deny**, or **Always allow** to whitelist the tool for the session. | Switch modes with `/mode`. Approve and the action runs; deny and Atlas backs off and tells you what it skipped. |

## What Makes It a Fleet, Not Just a Bot

**Memory that accumulates.** Agents save durable facts with `memory_write` and recall relevant ones automatically each turn. Three tiers: *hot* entries inject into every turn unconditionally; *warm* entries are keyword-recalled when relevant; *cold* entries are panel-only and excluded from agent context. Tiers decay automatically (hot to warm after 7 days without recall, warm to cold after 30 days) and can be promoted or demoted from the panel.

**Skills that compound.** When Atlas works out a procedure worth reusing, he distils it into the skills library with `skill_save`. Next time a similar request comes in, he pulls the skill and runs it. The library grows with use. Expensive turns (over $0.05 or 30s) trigger an automatic haiku extraction pass that proposes new skills for review.

**Leads with portfolios.** Each Lead has a domain (Finance, DevOps, Research, whatever you define). Their system prompt is shaped around that portfolio so they think and act like a specialist, not a generalist. Create a Lead for anything recurring in your life or work.

**Lead bots.** Give a Lead a Telegram bot token and they get their own chat. Message your Finance Lead directly with spend questions. Message your DevOps Lead directly for infra work. Same allowed-user list as Atlas, separate sessions and context.

**Atlas knows his team.** Every turn, Atlas's system prompt is automatically updated with the current Lead roster (who they are, what they own). He can reference them, delegate to them, and tell you which Lead to ask.

**Council votes.** Use `/council <proposal>` to put an idea to a full council vote from Telegram or directly from the panel Crew tab. Every enabled Lead evaluates the proposal from their domain's perspective and returns a SUPPORT or OPPOSE vote with a one-sentence reason and a one-sentence concern. Results arrive in Telegram with individual breakdowns and a final tally. All sessions are stored and visible in the panel Crew tab.

**Inter-agent delegation.** Atlas can delegate subtasks directly to Leads via `crew_delegate`, receive their output inline, and report back to you. Leads can ask you a question mid-turn with `crew_ask_president` (which pauses until you reply), file a report with `crew_report`, or queue non-urgent ideas for your review with `crew_suggest`. The suggestion inbox queues proposals for triage; you accept (turning it into a task) or dismiss from the panel Crew tab. A persistent delegation log tracks all cross-agent activity.

**Personas.** Give Atlas or any Lead a persona: concise and direct, warm and encouraging, formal and precise, or fully custom. Persona shapes character and tone; system prompt carries domain knowledge. Both are set separately and combine naturally.

**Autonomy levels.** Three tiers replace the old on/off toggle: *supervised* (every tool call prompts for approval), *standard* (safe read-only tools run freely, risky ones prompt (the default)), and *full* (no prompts, fully autonomous). Set globally per agent, or change per-chat with `/mode`.

**Language.** Choose the language Atlas or any Lead responds in. The panel Settings tab has a global default; individual agents can override it; and per-chat `/lang <code>` overrides them all. Thirty languages available (English, Hungarian, Spanish, French, German, and more). The panel interface itself is available in English and Hungarian.

**Autonomous delegation.** Task cards on the board can be delegated to an agent run with one button. The agent can break cards into subtasks, complete them, and move the card to Done without you touching it.

**Proactive monitoring.** The heartbeat runs in the background watching host health and stalled task cards. It can alert you, or it can run an autonomous turn to investigate and act first.

**Scheduled runs.** Set any agent or Lead to run a prompt on a timer: check disk space at 9am, summarize logs every 2 hours, pull a report every Monday. A daily maintenance window can compact memory (a small Haiku model reads the hot and warm tiers, consolidates near-duplicate entries into one clear entry, drops redundant copies, and shortens any entry over 220 characters into a single terse sentence) and auto-archive unused skills older than 14 days. A dry-run preview in the panel Health card shows which entries would be deleted, demoted, or merged before the next run fires.

**Claude usage tracking.** The System and Usage panels show live session and weekly limits pulled from the official Anthropic OAuth API (`GET /api/oauth/usage`, `GET /api/oauth/profile`) using the token the Claude Code CLI stores in your Keychain. No separate API key or credentials needed. Shows 5-hour session utilisation and 7-day weekly utilisation, each with an exact reset countdown, severity color, and auto-refresh on a configurable schedule (default 30 minutes). Historical activity (message counts, token breakdown by model, 14-day sparkline) comes from `~/.claude/stats-cache.json`. Subscription type (Claude Pro / Max) is auto-detected and shown in Settings.

**Budget tracking.** For API users, set a monthly cap and billing day. The Usage panel overlays a cap line on the daily cost chart and shows period spend, daily average, and estimated monthly total. Configure Telegram alerts at any threshold and optional automatic spend reports on a schedule.

## Bring Your Own Model

MyHQ isn't locked to Anthropic. Point any agent at any model: a hosted Claude tier, a local model served by **LM Studio** or **Ollama**, or any OpenAI-compatible proxy. Pick the model per role:

- **Main agent.** Set the model and provider that drives Atlas right from Settings (or with `/model` in chat). Switch between Opus, Sonnet, Haiku, or a local model live; the change takes effect on the next message.
- **Sub-agents.** Every Lead, Assistant, and worker can run on its own model and provider. Run cheap local models for routine background work and reserve a frontier model for the agents that need it.
- **Embeddings.** Semantic memory recall runs on a local embedding model. Auto mode probes Ollama (`:11434`) then LM Studio (`:1234`) at startup and uses whichever is live, so memory search works offline with no API key. Pin a backend or turn it off from Settings.
- **Voice.** Transcription runs on any OpenAI-compatible endpoint (OpenAI, Groq's free tier) or fully offline with Vosk.

Add a provider once (base URL + token, with LM Studio / Ollama prefill presets), and MyHQ lists its available models server-side so you can pick by name. Provider tokens are stored in the encrypted vault.

## Quick Install

### Linux / macOS

On a fresh machine, the wizard installs everything (Node 20+, git, the Claude CLI), clones the repo, builds it, walks you through `.env`, and optionally sets up a background service:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://gyorgy.sh/myhq-install.sh | bash
```

### Windows

Open PowerShell as Administrator and run:

```powershell
irm https://gyorgy.sh/myhq-install.ps1 | iex
```

The Windows installer uses `winget` for Node.js and Git, creates a NSSM service (with Task Scheduler as a fallback), and writes a sibling `myhq-update.ps1` for future updates.

---

You will need a [bot token](#setup-manual) and your numeric Telegram user id. The wizard prompts for both. Prefer to read before you run? The scripts are [`scripts/myhq-install.sh`](scripts/myhq-install.sh) and [`scripts/windows/myhq-install.ps1`](scripts/windows/myhq-install.ps1).

> For an unattended run, set `MYHQ_TOKEN`, `MYHQ_USER_IDS`, and `MYHQ_MODE=service|manual` (and `MYHQ_YES=1`) in the environment before running.

## Setup (manual)

> No background services installed: full functionality is available. Install as a service later without touching your checkout or data.

1. **Create a bot**: message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), run `/newbot`, copy the token.
2. **Find your user id**: message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot).
3. **Configure**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # edit .env: TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, ALLOWED_USER_IDS, WORKDIR
   ```
4. **Install and run**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev         # watch mode (reloads on change)
   # or: npm run build && npm start
   ```

## Run as a Service

```bash
./scripts/install-service.sh        # builds, installs and starts the service
./scripts/agentctl.sh status        # start | stop | restart | status | logs
./scripts/agentctl.sh logs          # follow logs
```

**Linux**: systemd unit (`myhq`). The installer adds a scoped, passwordless sudoers rule.

**macOS**: per-user LaunchAgent (`sh.gyorgy.myhq`) that runs in your login session; no sudo needed.

**Windows**: NSSM service (`myhq`) or Task Scheduler entry. Managed via `nssm start|stop|restart myhq` or the Task Scheduler GUI.

You can also ask Atlas to restart himself: "restart yourself" triggers `./scripts/agentctl.sh restart`.

### Update and uninstall

```bash
./scripts/update.sh                 # git pull + npm install + build, restarts if service is installed
./scripts/uninstall-service.sh      # remove the service (leaves checkout, .env and data/ intact)
```

### Voice

Send a voice note and it is transcribed and run like a typed prompt. Two backends via `TRANSCRIBE_PROVIDER`:

**`openai`** (default): any OpenAI-compatible `/audio/transcriptions` endpoint. Use OpenAI directly, or **Groq's free tier**: set `TRANSCRIBE_BASE_URL=https://api.groq.com/openai/v1`, `TRANSCRIBE_MODEL=whisper-large-v3-turbo`, and a Groq `OPENAI_API_KEY`.

**`vosk`**: fully local and offline.
```bash
npm install vosk
# install ffmpeg, download and unpack a model from https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models
```
Then set `VOSK_MODEL_PATH=/path/to/vosk-model` and `TRANSCRIBE_PROVIDER=vosk`.

## Enabling the Panel

The panel is served **in the same process** as the bot (no extra service). Off by default because it has the same reach as the bot.

```bash
PANEL_ENABLED=true
PANEL_TOKEN=choose-a-long-random-secret   # required; startup fails without it
```

```bash
npm run build && npm start
# dev: npm run dev   (bot + panel reload together)
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8787` and unlock with your `PANEL_TOKEN`. Keep the bind on loopback and reach it only behind a reverse proxy or private network (e.g. Tailscale). Light / dark / hacker themes, URL per view.

## Panel API

Everything the panel does is a REST call you can script. Auth is the same `PANEL_TOKEN`, sent as a Bearer header (`Authorization: Bearer $PANEL_TOKEN`) for REST and `?token=` for the WebSocket. All write endpoints take and return JSON. The full catalogue with copy-paste `curl` examples lives in [`work.md`](work.md) under "Fleet API (Panel)"; the groups are:

| Group | Endpoints |

| Realtime | `GET /ws` (worker, chat, task, health, tunnel, and log frames) |

## Permissions

Nothing runs without your say-so. For every non-read-only tool call you get an inline prompt showing exactly what is about to happen:

**Approve**: run it once.
**Deny**: refuse it.
**Always allow**: stop asking for that tool for the rest of this session.

Three autonomy levels via `/mode`:

- **supervised**: all tools prompt, nothing runs automatically. Strictest.
- **standard**: read-only tools (`Read` / `Glob` / `Grep`) run automatically; risky tools (Bash, Write, Edit) prompt. This is the default.
- **full**: bypass all permissions. Use for trusted autonomous runs.

Lead bots default to standard mode with the same approve/deny prompts.

## Full Feature List

- **Crew hierarchy**: President, Atlas, Leads, Assistants. Each level knows the one above it. Leads have portfolios, their own sessions, and optionally their own Telegram bots.
- **Council votes**: `/council <idea>` calls every enabled Lead, gets a SUPPORT/OPPOSE vote with domain reasoning from each, and delivers a tally to Telegram. Full history in the panel Crew tab.
- **Inter-agent crew tools**: `crew_delegate` (hand a task to a Lead and get their output back), `crew_report` (log a summary and optionally notify the president), `crew_ask_president` (pause until the user replies, then continue), `crew_suggest` (file a non-urgent idea to the president's inbox for triage; the president accepts it as a task or dismisses it from the panel Crew tab).
- **Memory tiers**: hot (every turn), warm (keyword-recalled), cold (panel-only). Auto-decay and promote/demote controls in the panel.
- **Semantic memory**: recall ranks by meaning using a local embedding model, blending cosine similarity with keyword overlap and salience. On by default in auto mode: at startup the bot probes Ollama then LM Studio and enables embeddings against whichever is live, with zero configuration, re-selecting the live backend on every restart. It falls back to keyword search whenever no backend is reachable, so it is always safe to leave on. The Settings tab has an **Auto / Manual / Off** control (Auto is the default), shows live up/down status and available models for each local backend, one-click connect, and a preferred-backend pick when both are running. Non-panel users can force the mode with `EMBEDDING_ENABLED=auto|on|off` in `.env`, which locks the panel control when set to `on` or `off`.
- **Auto skill extraction**: after expensive turns, an async haiku pass checks whether the work established a reusable procedure and proposes a skill entry. Gated by `AUTO_SKILL_GENERATION=true`.
- **Maintenance scheduler**: daily window for memory compaction (demote stale entries, a small Haiku model consolidates near-duplicate hot and warm entries into one clear entry and drops redundant copies, and any entry over `MEMORY_SHORTEN_CHARS` characters is condensed into a single terse sentence) and skill pruning (auto-archive unused skills older than 14 days). Triggered by `MAINTENANCE_CRON=HH:MM` or the panel's "Run now". The AI consolidation runs through the same Claude connection as the bot (CLI login or API key), so no separate key is needed; the deterministic demote/delete steps run regardless. A **dry-run preview** in the panel Health card shows which entries would be deleted, demoted, or merged before the next run fires (`POST /api/maintenance/preview`). Last-run time is cached across restarts and the System panel shows both the last and next run.
- **Personas**: preset options (Concise, Warm, Formal, Analytical, Playful) or fully custom. Persona shapes character and tone; domain knowledge stays separate in the system prompt.
- **Autonomy levels**: supervised / standard / full, replacing the old safe/auto toggle. Per-agent, per-session, and settable from the panel.
- **Language**: 30 languages for agent responses; global default from Settings; per-agent override on each Lead; per-chat `/lang` command. Panel interface available in English and Hungarian.
- **Branding overrides**: `ATLAS_NAME` and `BRAND_NAME` let you rename the system for self-hosted deployments.
- **Live streaming**: Telegram Rich Messages (Bot API 10.1) and message drafts (Bot API 9.3): replies animate as previews and land as clean, structured messages.
- **Proactive monitoring**: optional heartbeat watches host health (CPU/mem/swap/disk) and stalled task cards, pinging Telegram on breach, or running an autonomous turn to investigate first.
- **Secret vault**: AES-256-GCM encrypted secrets with the master key in the macOS Keychain (file fallback on Linux). Reference secrets anywhere as `vault:<id>`.
- **Multi-agent task delegation**: task board cards can be delegated to an autonomous run. The agent can break cards into subtasks, complete them, and move the card to Done.
- **Custom task columns**: the Kanban board starts with Planned / In Progress / Done but you can rename any column and add as many as you need. Columns are managed from the board header with a single click.
- **Live Claude usage**: the System and Usage panels pull real 5-hour session and 7-day weekly limit percentages from `GET /api/oauth/usage` using the OAuth token the Claude Code CLI stores in your Keychain. No extra credentials needed. Subscription type auto-detected. Configurable auto-refresh (default 30 min) and a "Check now" button. Historical stats (message counts, token breakdown, 14-day sparkline) from `~/.claude/stats-cache.json`.
- **Budget tracking**: API users can set a monthly cap and billing day. Usage panel shows period spend vs cap with a progress bar, daily average, and estimated monthly total. Telegram alerts at any threshold, configurable spend report schedule.
- **Operator playbook (`work.md`)**: define once how recurring jobs should be done. Re-read every turn, so edits apply instantly.
- **Session continuity**: context carries across messages; `/new` resets it. Sessions (resume token, cwd, autonomy, language, allow-lists, usage) survive restarts.
- **Git review from chat**: `/diff` shows the diff with inline Commit / Discard buttons; `/commit <message>` stages and commits.
- **Voice notes**: transcribed and run as prompts via OpenAI-compatible API (OpenAI, Groq) or fully local Vosk.
- **Local model support**: point Atlas or any Lead at LM Studio, Ollama, or any Anthropic-compatible proxy, switchable live from the Settings tab.
- **File send/receive**: upload files and photos (agents see images inline); agents can send files back via the built-in `send_file` tool.
- **Scheduled runs**: timed autonomous prompts on any interval or daily time, per-agent.
- **Persistent logs**: agent activity is written to dated NDJSON files in `logs/` (one per day, never truncated on restart). Files older than 72 hours rotate automatically. Secrets (bearer tokens, API keys, bot tokens, `key=value` credential pairs) are redacted before any line is written or shown. The panel Logs view has three tabs: an **Activity** feed of human-readable rows (Reading, Running command, Editing, plus lifecycle events like new messages, scheduled runs, and updates), the raw **Logs** view (browse and search any past day by date, level, or keyword, including a cross-file 72h search), and **Analytics** (most-used tools and shell commands).
- **Live model switching**: `/model` shows shortcut buttons for the main Claude tiers (Opus, Sonnet, Haiku) and lists any configured local or provider models as text. Switch with one tap or `/model <name>` directly. Takes effect on the next message.
- **Session resume after restart**: the first Telegram message after a restart offers to resume the previous conversation or start fresh, so a deploy or reboot never silently drops your context. Auto-resumes after 10 seconds if you do not pick.
- **Panel terminal**: a real shell session in the browser for quick checks without SSH, served over the same authenticated WebSocket as the rest of the panel. **Off by default** (`PANEL_TERMINAL_ENABLED`) since a panel-token holder would otherwise get arbitrary host execution; when on, the shell gets a sanitized env so it can't read the bot's secrets back out.
- **Remote access (tunnel)**: expose the loopback panel to the internet so you can reach it from your phone, still behind the panel login. The Remote Access view spawns an **ngrok** or **cloudflared** relay pointed at the panel port and shows the public URL. **Off by default** (`PANEL_TUNNEL_ENABLED`); even when enabled the relay only runs on an explicit Start (or auto-start after a reboot), an HTTP Basic Auth gate (username `myhq`, auto-generated password) sits in front as a second factor, the public URL and login are DM'd to you and surfaced by `/status`, and the ngrok token is stored in the vault.
- **AskUserQuestion inline buttons**: when an agent calls `AskUserQuestion`, the choices render as Telegram inline buttons instead of freeform text. Tapping a button resolves the question instantly; a free-text fallback is always available. Works in both the main Atlas bot and Lead bots.
- **Agentic loop detection**: a per-turn guard hashes each tool call and, after `LOOP_THRESHOLD` identical repeats (default 3), prompts you to Skip / Approve once / Continue (interactive turns) or aborts a runaway autonomous turn, so a stuck retry loop can't burn tokens overnight.
- **Security hardening**: the panel token is rate-limited against brute force, enforced to a 16-char minimum (a weak or missing token is auto-healed on startup and the new one DM'd to you), and only accepted as a Bearer header for REST (never a query string). Provider auth tokens are never returned in plaintext. Server-side outbound fetches are SSRF-guarded (cloud-metadata and link-local IPs blocked). Lead bots enforce private-chat-only auth. The `.claude` file editor is locked to known directories with symlink-escape protection. The data dir is `chmod 0700`, store reads are protected against prototype pollution, and Telegram-added group members can't read agent output.
- **In-panel updates**: the Updates view checks for a new version, applies it, and can roll back, mirroring `scripts/update.sh` without leaving the dashboard.
- **Connectors catalogue**: a registry for external services (Gmail, Google Calendar, Google Drive, Notion, Apple Calendar, Apple Mail) with a vault-backed credential slot, ready to wire up (placeholders for now).

Built on [`telegraf`](https://github.com/telegraf/telegraf) and [`@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk); the panel uses [`fastify`](https://fastify.dev) + [`systeminformation`](https://systeminformation.io) on the server and React + Vite + Tailwind on the client.

## Troubleshooting

**Atlas doesn't respond**: confirm your numeric id is in `ALLOWED_USER_IDS`: unknown users are silently ignored. Check logs with `LOG_LEVEL=debug`.

**`npm start` shows stale behavior**: `npm start` runs compiled `dist/`; rebuild with `npm run build` first.

**Rich formatting looks off**: try `STREAM_MODE=draft` or `STREAM_MODE=edit`. Rich/draft modes require a private chat.

**Approvals never resolve**: make sure only one instance is polling: two pollers split updates.

**Lead bot not starting**: check that `telegramToken` is a valid `vault:<id>` reference pointing to a real bot token in the vault, and that the Lead is enabled. Lead bots start and stop live when you create, enable, or disable a worker from the panel, no restart required.

**Council returns no votes**: ensure you have at least one Lead worker enabled. Leads without a `cwd` set will default to `WORKDIR`.

**Language not applying**: the per-chat `/lang` command overrides the per-agent default. Use `/lang` with no argument to see the current setting and available codes.
