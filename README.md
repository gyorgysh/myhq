# claude-code-telegram

**A self-hosted AI operator for your machines — reach it over Telegram or the CCT Panel web dashboard.**

Open source. It puts a real **Claude Code** agent on your box and lets you drive it from your phone or a browser: check on services, restart things, read logs, edit a crontab, ship code, answer questions about the system — all in plain language, with the reply streaming back live and every risky action gated behind your approval.

It has grown well past a chat bot. It's a small **multi-agent platform**: a main agent you talk to, named **sub-agents** that run on a schedule or on demand, and a task board whose cards you can **delegate to an agent**. It runs on **cloud models** (Opus / Sonnet / Haiku) *or* your **own local LLMs** (LM Studio, Ollama) *or* any proxy — mix them freely. It **remembers what it learns** and recalls the relevant pieces into each conversation, so it adapts to you over time. And it's built in the open and improving fast — including self-updating itself.

> ⚠️ **This can read, write, and run commands on the machine it runs on.** Access is gated only by a Telegram user-id allow-list (and, for the panel, a secret token). Keep `ALLOWED_USER_IDS` tight and run it somewhere you control.

## Two ways in

The same agent, two front doors:

- **Telegram** — message a bot from your phone. The old loop for touching a server (open a terminal, SSH in, run something, close the session) becomes a chat with something already running on the box that knows the system. When a service falls over at 2am you get a ping and fix it from the couch, no SSH client required.
- **CCT Panel** — an optional web dashboard served by the *same process*: chat with the agent in the browser, watch live system health and model-backend status, run and schedule sub-agents, delegate task-board cards, browse and edit the agent's memory and skills, manage secrets, and tune proactive monitoring. See [CCT Panel](#cct-panel--the-web-dashboard).

## Where it's going

This is actively built in the open. The agent already **learns and adapts** — it writes durable memories, recalls them into future turns, and distils reusable skills on its own — and the platform keeps growing: richer memory, more connectors (Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Notion are stubbed in), deeper autonomy, and one-click panel updates are on the way. The aim is simple: the last operator you need to install on a box. Issues and PRs welcome.

## Features

- **Live streaming, the native way** — uses Telegram's streaming APIs: **Rich Messages** (Bot API 10.1) and **message drafts** (Bot API 9.3) so replies stream in as an animated preview and land as cleanly formatted, structured messages. A legacy edit-in-place mode is available as a fallback. See [Streaming modes](#streaming-modes).
- **CCT Panel — the web dashboard (optional)** — a full embedded UI with a left-sidebar layout: **chat with the agent** in the browser, live **system health**, a **model-backend status** page, **sub-agent workers**, a **task board** (with delegate-to-agent), a **skills** library, **durable memory**, a **secret vault**, **heartbeat** monitoring, schedules, sessions, usage, live logs and more. Off by default; token-gated; light / dark / hacker themes. See [CCT Panel](#cct-panel--the-web-dashboard).
- **Durable memory** — the agent remembers durable facts across conversations and recalls the relevant ones into each turn automatically (own `memory_*` tools; editable in the panel). It can also distil reusable workflows into the **skills** library itself.
- **Proactive monitoring** — an optional **heartbeat** watches host health (CPU/mem/swap/disk) and stalled task cards and pings you on Telegram when something's noteworthy — deterministic alerts, or an autonomous turn that investigates and acts.
- **Secret vault** — AES-256-GCM encrypted secrets with the master key in the macOS Keychain (file fallback on Linux); reference them as `vault:<id>` so provider tokens never sit in plaintext.
- **Permission-first** — nothing runs without your say-so. Read-only tools (Read/Glob/Grep…) run automatically; anything that touches the system (`Bash`/`Write`/`Edit`…) pauses for **✅ Approve · ❌ Deny · ♾️ Always allow** inline buttons. "Always allow" whitelists that tool for the rest of the session; approvals auto-deny on timeout so nothing hangs.
- **A capable, on-task personality** — smart, resourceful, and concise for a phone screen, with the occasional joke but work first, fun later. Tunable in `src/prompt.ts`.
- **Operator playbook (`work.md`)** — define how recurring jobs should be done ("restart Apache", crontab edits, deploys, schedules) once, and the bot follows your conventions every time. See [work.md](#workmd--your-operator-playbook).
- **Session continuity** — context carries across messages; `/new` resets it. Sessions (resume token, cwd, mode, allow-list, cost totals) are **persisted to disk**, so they survive a restart.
- **Git review from chat** — `/diff` shows the working-tree diff (as a `.diff` file when large) with inline **Commit / Discard** buttons; `/commit <message>` stages and commits.
- **Cost & usage tracking** — `/usage` reports turns, spend, and time for the chat (today + lifetime).
- **Voice notes** — send a voice message and it's transcribed and run as a prompt. Two backends via `TRANSCRIBE_PROVIDER`: an OpenAI-compatible API (OpenAI, or Groq's free tier), or fully local **Vosk** (offline, English, needs `ffmpeg`).
- **Scheduled prompts** — `/schedule add 2h | check disk space` runs a prompt on a timer (interval or daily), autonomously, and pushes the result back to the chat.
- **Multi-project switching** — `/projects` saves working dirs and switches between them with inline buttons.
- **Persistent approval presets** — “Always allow” remembers a tool (or a specific Bash program like `git`) across restarts; manage with `/allow`, `/allowed`, `/disallow`. A middle ground between fully interactive `safe` and hands-off `auto`.
- **Working directory control** — `/cd`, `/pwd`, `/status`.
- **File send/receive** — upload files/photos (Claude *sees* images inline); Claude can send files back via a built-in `send_file` tool (images arrive as photos).
- **Quiet by default** — messages from anyone not on the allow-list are silently ignored (no reply, no trace).

## Platforms

Runs anywhere Node.js 20+ runs — **Linux**, **macOS**, and **Windows** — using the npm scripts (`npm install`, `npm run dev` / `npm run build && npm start`).

Authentication for Claude itself reuses your existing `claude` CLI login, or set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` in `.env`. Uses long polling, so no public webhook or open port is needed.

## Quick install (one-liner)

On a fresh **Linux** or **macOS** box, the wizard installs everything for you — Homebrew (macOS), Node 20+, git, and the Claude Code CLI — checks RAM (and offers to add swap on small Linux boxes), clones the repo, builds it, walks you through `.env`, optionally sets up voice transcription (cloud API or local Vosk + ffmpeg, model downloaded for you), and offers to run as a background service:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://gyorgy.sh/cct-install.sh | bash
```

You'll still need a [bot token](#setup) and your numeric user id to hand it (it prompts for both). Prefer to read before you run? The script is [`scripts/cct-install.sh`](scripts/cct-install.sh).

> The wizard is interactive — it reads your answers from the terminal even when piped through `curl`. For an unattended run, set `CCT_TOKEN`, `CCT_USER_IDS`, and `CCT_MODE=service|manual` (and `CCT_YES=1`) in the environment.

## Setup (manual)

1. **Create a bot**: message [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather), run `/newbot`, copy the token.
2. **Find your user id**: message [@userinfobot](https://t.me/userinfobot).
3. **Configure**:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # edit .env: TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, ALLOWED_USER_IDS, WORKDIR
   ```
4. **Install & run**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run dev         # watch mode (reloads on change)
   # or: npm run build && npm start
   ```

## Run as a service (Linux & macOS)

For an always-on deployment, install the bot as an OS service. The same commands work on both platforms — they dispatch to **systemd** on Linux and **launchd** on macOS:

```bash
./scripts/install-service.sh        # builds, installs + starts the service
./scripts/agentctl.sh status        # start | stop | restart | status | logs
./scripts/agentctl.sh logs          # follow logs
```

- **Linux** — a systemd unit (`telegram-agent`). The installer also adds a scoped, passwordless sudoers rule for just this service.
- **macOS** — a per-user LaunchAgent (`sh.gyorgy.telegram-agent`) that runs in your login session (where the `claude` CLI login lives); no sudo needed.

Either way you can **ask the agent to restart itself** ("restart yourself" → `./scripts/agentctl.sh restart`); the management commands are documented in `work.md`. The launcher `scripts/run.sh` can also be run directly without any service manager.

### Update & uninstall

```bash
./scripts/update.sh                 # git pull + npm install + build, restarts the service if installed
./scripts/uninstall-service.sh      # remove the service (leaves the checkout, .env and data/ intact)
```

`update.sh` refuses to run with uncommitted changes and only restarts when a service is actually installed, so it's safe whether you run as a service or by hand.

```
scripts/
  cct-install.sh         # one-liner bootstrap wizard (curl | bash)
  run.sh                 # launcher (build if needed, then run)
  update.sh              # pull + rebuild + restart
  install-service.sh     # installer    → dispatches by OS
  uninstall-service.sh   # uninstaller  → dispatches by OS
  agentctl.sh            # manager       → dispatches by OS
  linux/                 # systemd implementation
  macos/                 # launchd implementation
```

## Configuration

| Variable | Required | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | yes | Token from @BotFather |
| `ALLOWED_USER_IDS` | yes | Comma-separated numeric Telegram user ids (the allow-list) |
| `WORKDIR` | no | Directory Claude starts in (default: the gitignored `data/` folder, so agent-created files stay out of the repo) |
| `STATE_FILE` | no | Where session + usage state is persisted across restarts (default `data/state.json`) |
| `CLAUDE_MODEL` | no | Model id (default `claude-opus-4-8`) |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | no | API key; omit to use `claude` CLI login |
| `APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_MS` | no | Approval wait before auto-deny (default 300000) |
| `STREAM_MODE` | no | `rich` (default), `draft`, or `edit` — see below |
| `TRANSCRIBE_PROVIDER` | no | Voice backend: `openai` (default) or `vosk` (local) |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | no | API key for the `openai` voice backend (OpenAI, Groq, …) |
| `TRANSCRIBE_MODEL` | no | Transcription model for `openai` (default `whisper-1`) |
| `TRANSCRIBE_BASE_URL` | no | OpenAI-compatible base URL (default `https://api.openai.com/v1`) |
| `VOSK_MODEL_PATH` | no | Path to an unpacked Vosk model dir (enables the `vosk` backend) |
| `FFMPEG_PATH` | no | ffmpeg binary used to decode voice notes for Vosk (default `ffmpeg`) |
| `LOG_LEVEL` | no | `error` \| `warn` \| `info` (default) \| `debug` |
| `WORK_FILE` | no | Path to the operator playbook (default `work.md`) |
| `PANEL_ENABLED` | no | `true` to start the CCT Panel web dashboard (default `false`) |
| `PANEL_TOKEN` | when panel on | Shared secret required on every panel request/WS — startup fails if the panel is enabled without it |
| `PANEL_HOST` | no | Bind address (default `127.0.0.1` — loopback) |
| `PANEL_PORT` | no | Port (default `8787`) |
| `PANEL_CHAT_ENABLED` | no | `false` to hide the panel Chat view and disable its endpoints (default `true`) |
| `PANEL_CHAT_BYPASS` | no | `true` to unlock the Chat's auto (no-approval) mode; otherwise risky tools prompt for approval in the panel (default `false`) |

### Streaming modes

| Mode | How it streams | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `rich` | Bot API 10.1 Rich Messages (`sendRichMessageDraft` → `sendRichMessage`) | Default. Structured formatting; sent as safe escaped HTML so code (`<…>`, `#`, `$`) never breaks the parser. Private chats only. |
| `draft` | Bot API 9.3 `sendMessageDraft` → `sendMessage` | Plain animated preview, finalized as a formatted message. Private chats only. |
| `edit` | Throttled `editMessageText` of a placeholder | Most battle-tested fallback; works in any chat. |

### Voice transcription

Send a voice note and it's transcribed, then run like a typed prompt. Choose a backend with `TRANSCRIBE_PROVIDER`:

- **`openai`** (default) — any OpenAI-compatible `/audio/transcriptions` host. Use OpenAI directly, or **Groq's free tier** by setting `TRANSCRIBE_BASE_URL=https://api.groq.com/openai/v1`, `TRANSCRIBE_MODEL=whisper-large-v3-turbo`, and `OPENAI_API_KEY` to a Groq key.
- **`vosk`** — fully local and offline, no API. One-time setup:
  ```bash
  npm install vosk                 # optional native dependency
  # install ffmpeg via your package manager (brew/apt/…)
  # download + unpack a model from https://alphacephei.com/vosk/models
  #   e.g. vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15 (~40MB)
  ```
  Then set `VOSK_MODEL_PATH=/path/to/vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15` and `TRANSCRIBE_PROVIDER=vosk`. ffmpeg decodes Telegram's OGG/Opus to the 16kHz PCM Vosk expects. The small English model is fast on a CPU; larger models trade speed for accuracy.

## CCT Panel — the web dashboard

**CCT Panel** is the optional web dashboard, served **in the same process** as the bot (no extra service), for driving and managing everything from a browser. It's **off by default** because it can read host data and launch autonomous agents — the same reach as the bot itself.

Enable it in `.env`:

```bash
PANEL_ENABLED=true
PANEL_TOKEN=choose-a-long-random-secret   # required; startup fails without it
# PANEL_HOST=127.0.0.1   # loopback by default
# PANEL_PORT=8787
```

Then build the panel UI and start as usual:

```bash
npm run build      # builds the panel, then the bot (or: npm run build:panel)
npm start
# dev: npm run dev  — runs the bot AND rebuilds the panel on change (served
#                     together at the same URL, never stale)
#      panel HMR:   npm run panel:dev (Vite dev server with hot reload, proxies the API)
```

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8787` and unlock with your `PANEL_TOKEN`. It's a left-sidebar dashboard grouped into **Monitor**, **Operate**, **Configure** and **Others**, with light / dark / hacker themes and a URL per view (so a refresh reloads the same page). What's inside:

- **Chat** — talk to the agent right in the browser. It's a dedicated, persistent Claude session (separate from Telegram) that streams live; risky tools pause for **Approve / Deny** in the panel, unless you unlock an auto (no-prompt) mode via `PANEL_CHAT_BYPASS`. Disable the whole view with `PANEL_CHAT_ENABLED=false`.
- **System** — live CPU (overall + per-core), memory, swap, disk usage and disk I/O, pushed over a WebSocket.
- **Status** — the public Claude service status (no API key needed) plus reachability, auth and model lists for each configured provider and any running local backend (LM Studio / Ollama).
- **Agents** — configure both the **main agent** and **sub-agent workers** on one page:
  - **Main agent** (drives your Telegram chats): switch its **model** (Opus/Sonnet/Haiku or a local model) and **provider** at runtime — changes apply on the next message. Plus **New context** (abort any running turn and clear conversation history) and **Restart service** (full respawn, when running under systemd/launchd).
  - **Workers** — persisted **sub-agents**: name, working directory, task prompt, model, optional persona/skill, and an optional schedule (`30m`/`2h`/`HH:MM`). Run on demand or on the timer; runs are **concurrent** and autonomous (no approval prompts), with **live streaming output** and per-worker run history (status, cost, duration). Picking Haiku makes cheap background agents practical.
  - **Local models** — define a **provider** (an Anthropic-compatible base URL + auth token, e.g. **LM Studio** `http://localhost:1234` or **Ollama**) with one-click presets, and **fetch its model list** with a button. Point the main agent or any worker at it with a free-text model name (`qwen/qwen3.6-35b-a3b`, …), so you can mix cloud and local freely. (You can also run the whole bot on a local model from `.env` via `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` + `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`.)
- **Tasks** — a board (Backlog / In progress / Done) with drag-and-drop, priority, WIP limits, card aging, and **delegate-to-agent**: hand a card to an autonomous run that streams progress and moves it to Done (and can break it into subtasks).
- **Schedules** — create, view and delete timed autonomous prompts (the same jobs as `/schedule`).
- **Heartbeat** — proactive monitoring: pick **off / alert / active**, set health thresholds and the stalled-card window, see recent alerts, or run a check now.
- **Skills** — a reusable **prompt library** (the agent can add to it itself), plus a scoped editor for the on-disk `.claude/{agents,skills,commands}/*.md` and `CLAUDE.md` files the agent loads from your working dirs.
- **Memory** — browse, search, edit and delete the durable facts the agent has learned.
- **Vault** — AES-256-GCM encrypted secrets; reveal/edit, and **scan & import** to move plaintext provider tokens onto `vault:<id>` references.
- **Connectors** — placeholders for Gmail / Google Calendar / Drive / Notion (registration surface + vault-backed credential slot; not wired up yet).
- **Prompt** — view the built-in personality and edit the operator playbook (`work.md`) live.
- **Logs** — a live tail of the bot's activity (turns, tool calls, errors, worker lifecycle), streamed over the WebSocket with level filters. (The agent runs headless via the SDK — there's no terminal to attach to — so this is the "remote view".)
- **Sessions / Usage / Updates** — live session state, cost/usage charts, and current version.

Every request and WebSocket handshake requires the token (sent as a `Bearer` header / `?token=`), and write actions are recorded to an audit log (`data/audit.jsonl`). Keep the bind on loopback and reach it remotely only behind a reverse proxy or a private network (e.g. Tailscale) — never expose it raw.

## Permissions

The bot never runs commands on its own. For every non-read-only tool call you get an inline prompt showing exactly what Claude wants to do:

- **✅ Approve** — run it once.
- **❌ Deny** — refuse it.
- **♾️ Always allow `<Tool>`** — stop asking for that tool for the rest of this session (until `/new` or a restart).

To run without prompts entirely, switch a chat to autonomous mode with `/mode auto` (and back with `/mode safe`). Read-only tools always run automatically.

## work.md — your operator playbook

`work.md` is a plain-markdown file the bot appends to Claude's system prompt **on every turn** (so edits apply instantly, no restart). Use it to define how common, recurring tasks should be done so they happen the same way each time — for example:

- "restart Apache" → the exact command and a config test first
- editing **crontab** safely (diff, back up, non-interactive install) and scheduling jobs
- deploy steps for your projects
- ground rules (confirm destructive actions, prefer non-interactive commands)

A starter template ships in `work.md`; replace the examples with what's true for your machine. Point `WORK_FILE` elsewhere to use a different file.

## Commands

| Command | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `/new` | Start a fresh conversation |
| `/cd <path>` | Change working directory |
| `/pwd` | Show current directory |
| `/status` | Show session info (cwd, model, mode, session id) |
| `/projects` | Saved working dirs; switch/add/remove via inline buttons |
| `/diff` | Review the working-tree diff, then commit or discard inline |
| `/commit <message>` | Stage all changes and commit |
| `/usage` | Show cost & activity for this chat (today + lifetime) |
| `/allow <Tool>` · `/allowed` · `/disallow <Tool\|all>` | Manage persistent always-allow rules |
| `/schedule [list]` · `/schedule add <when> \| <prompt>` · `/schedule rm <id>` | Timed autonomous prompts (`when` = `30m`/`2h`/`1d` or `HH:MM`) |
| `/stop` | Abort the running request |
| `/mode safe\|auto` | Interactive approval (default) or autonomous |
| `/help` | Show help |

You can also send a **voice note** (transcribed and run as a prompt) or upload **files/photos** (Claude sees images inline).

Built on [`telegraf`](https://github.com/telegraf/telegraf) and [`@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anthropic-ai/claude-agent-sdk); the optional panel uses [`fastify`](https://fastify.dev) + [`systeminformation`](https://systeminformation.io) on the server and React + Vite + Tailwind on the client.

## Support & troubleshooting

- **Bot doesn't respond at all** — confirm your numeric id is in `ALLOWED_USER_IDS`; unknown users are ignored silently. Check the console logs (raise detail with `LOG_LEVEL=debug`).
- **`npm start` shows stale behavior** — `npm start` runs the compiled `dist/`; rebuild with `npm run build` first.
- **Rich formatting looks off** — try `STREAM_MODE=draft` or `STREAM_MODE=edit` in `.env`. Rich/draft modes require a **private** chat.
- **Approvals never resolve** — make sure only **one** instance is polling; two pollers split updates and cause conflicts.
