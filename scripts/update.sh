#   - local edits to *tracked* files (including regenerated package-lock.json
#     drift from `npm install`) are discarded — no commit/stash dance needed;
#   - *untracked* extra files in the tree (stray scripts, scratch output, the
#     gitignored data/ dir) are left untouched and never block the update the
#     way `git pull` does ("untracked files would be overwritten").
# Exception: work.md (the operator playbook) is backed up and restored across the
# reset below, so local/panel edits to it survive an update.
# Preserve the operator playbook (work.md). It's tracked in the repo as a starter
# template, but is meant to be customized per-box — and the management panel
# writes the live playbook to it. The hard reset below would otherwise discard
# those local edits, so stash a copy and restore it afterward (local wins over
