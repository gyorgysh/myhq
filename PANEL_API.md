# Panel REST API

Complete reference (with copy-paste `curl` examples) for the MyHQ Panel REST API.
The agent does not need this for normal operation — it manages the fleet through its
MCP tools — so it lives here rather than in `work.md` (which loads every turn). Read
this file when you need to script the panel or call an endpoint directly.


When the panel is enabled, the full fleet can be managed programmatically via a
local REST API. Use `curl` with the Bearer token from `.env`:

```bash
source .env
BASE="http://127.0.0.1:${PANEL_PORT:-8787}"
AUTH="Authorization: Bearer $PANEL_TOKEN"
```

All write endpoints accept and return JSON. Replace `$BASE` and `$AUTH` with the
above in every example. Endpoints return `{ error: "..." }` with a 4xx status on
failure.

### Workers (Leads, Assistants, specialists)

```bash
# List all workers
curl -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/workers

# Create a worker (Lead with its own Telegram bot)
curl -X POST -H "$AUTH" -H "Content-Type: application/json" $BASE/api/workers \

# Stop a running worker

# Force a Lead's Telegram bot to restart right now (404 if not a live Lead:

### Tasks (Kanban board)

```bash
# List all tasks, columns, and WIP limits
curl -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/tasks

# Create a task
curl -X POST -H "$AUTH" -H "Content-Type: application/json" $BASE/api/tasks \

# Update a task (move column, change priority, edit notes)
curl -X PATCH -H "$AUTH" -H "Content-Type: application/json" $BASE/api/tasks/<id> \
  -d '{ "column": "doing", "priority": "high" }'
# recurrence: make a card a recurring template (accepted on create and update).
# The template stays put and spawns a fresh backlog copy on each cadence (copies
# don't carry the recurrence). Shapes:
#   { "kind": "daily",   "hour": 9, "minute": 0 }
#   { "kind": "weekly",  "dayOfWeek": 1, "hour": 9, "minute": 0 }   # 0=Sun..6=Sat
#   { "kind": "monthly", "dayOfMonth": 1, "hour": 9, "minute": 0 }  # 1..31
# Pass recurrence: null on update to stop the card repeating.
curl -X PATCH -H "$AUTH" -H "Content-Type: application/json" $BASE/api/tasks/<id> \
  -d '{ "recurrence": { "kind": "weekly", "dayOfWeek": 1, "hour": 9, "minute": 0 } }'

# Delegate a card to an autonomous agent run.

curl -X POST -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/tasks/<id>/retry

# Unstick a card jammed in queued/running/error (e.g. orphaned by a crash):
# aborts any live run, drops it from the queue, and clears its delegation
# WITHOUT re-running it. Cards left "queued"/"running" by a restart are also
# auto-reconciled to a retryable error on boot.
curl -X POST -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/tasks/<id>/unstick

# Get / update delegation run settings (timeoutMs, maxConcurrent)
curl -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/tasks/config
curl -X PUT -H "$AUTH" -H "Content-Type: application/json" $BASE/api/tasks/config \
  -d '{ "timeoutMs": 600000, "maxConcurrent": 3 }'

# Delete a task
curl -X DELETE -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/tasks/<id>

### Schedules

```bash
# List scheduled prompts
curl -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/schedules

# Add a schedule
curl -X POST -H "$AUTH" -H "Content-Type: application/json" $BASE/api/schedules \
  -d '{ "prompt": "Check disk usage and alert if over 80%", "when": "09:00", "cwd": "/home/user" }'

  -d '{ "enabled": false }'

# Remove a schedule
curl -X DELETE -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/schedules/<id>
```

### Webhook triggers (inbound)

Register endpoints that external services hit to fire an autonomous run. The
management routes below are token-gated like the rest of `/api`. The actual
**firing endpoint is public** (`POST /hook/<id>`, no Bearer token) and instead
authenticates with an HMAC-SHA256 signature of the raw request body using the
trigger's own secret.

```bash
# List triggers (secrets are returned only as a 4-char hint) + the base URL
curl -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/webhook-triggers

# Create a trigger (returns the new trigger; secret is generated server-side)
curl -X POST -H "$AUTH" -H "Content-Type: application/json" $BASE/api/webhook-triggers \
  -d '{ "name": "GitHub push", "prompt": "Triage this push event", "leadId": "" }'

# Update a trigger (name, prompt, cwd, leadId, enabled)
curl -X PUT -H "$AUTH" -H "Content-Type: application/json" $BASE/api/webhook-triggers/<id> \
  -d '{ "enabled": false }'

# Rotate the signing secret (the caller must be reconfigured afterwards)
curl -X POST -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/webhook-triggers/<id>/rotate

# Reveal the signing secret + a ready-to-paste signed sample for testing
curl -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/webhook-triggers/<id>/secret

# Remove a trigger
curl -X DELETE -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/webhook-triggers/<id>

# Fire a trigger (PUBLIC — no Bearer token; HMAC-SHA256 over the raw body).
# Compute the digest with the trigger's secret, send it in X-Signature-256
# (GitHub's X-Hub-Signature-256 and a bare hex digest are also accepted).
BODY='{"hello":"world"}'
SIG=$(printf '%s' "$BODY" | openssl dgst -sha256 -hmac "<secret>" | awk '{print $2}')
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "X-Signature-256: sha256=$SIG" \
  --data "$BODY" $BASE/hook/<id>
# 202 → a backlog card was filed and delegated to an autonomous run
```

### Webhook tools (outbound)

Register an arbitrary HTTP endpoint as a callable agent tool. Each definition
surfaces to the agent as `webhook_<slug>_<id>`; the agent fills the declared
params and the call is issued through the SSRF-guarded `safeFetch`. Static
`headers` values may be `vault:<id>` references (resolved at call time, so an
`Authorization` header can hold a secret without storing it in plaintext).

```bash
# List tool definitions (secret header values returned only as a hint)
curl -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/webhook-tools

# Create a tool. `params` declare what the agent fills in and where each goes
# (query | header | body | path; a path param fills the {name} placeholder).
curl -X POST -H "$AUTH" -H "Content-Type: application/json" $BASE/api/webhook-tools \
  -d '{
    "name": "Create Linear issue",
    "description": "Open a new Linear issue",
    "method": "POST",
    "url": "https://api.linear.app/graphql",
    "headers": { "Authorization": "vault:<secret-id>" },
    "params": [{ "name": "title", "in": "body", "required": true }]
  }'

# Update / delete a tool
curl -X PUT -H "$AUTH" -H "Content-Type: application/json" $BASE/api/webhook-tools/<id> \
  -d '{ "method": "GET" }'
curl -X DELETE -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/webhook-tools/<id>

  -d '{ "text": "Prod DB host is db.internal:5432", "tags": ["prod", "db"], "tier": "hot" }'
# tier: "hot" (every turn), "warm" (keyword-recalled), "cold" (panel-only)

# Toggle semantic memory embeddings
curl -X PUT -H "$AUTH" -H "Content-Type: application/json" $BASE/api/agent/embeddings \

# Returns { blob: "vaultbak1.<salt>.<iv>.<tag>.<ct>" }

# Restore from a backup blob (additive: existing secrets untouched)
curl -X POST -H "$AUTH" -H "Content-Type: application/json" $BASE/api/vault/import-backup \
  -d '{ "blob": "vaultbak1.…", "passphrase": "at-least-8-chars" }'
```

### Backup & restore (whole-fleet state)

```bash

# quietStart / quietEnd: HH:MM (server local time). Signals in this window are
#   silently dropped. Wraps midnight correctly (e.g. 23:00–07:00).
# calendarEnabled: scan Google/Apple Calendar for upcoming events and brief
#   Atlas before each one. Requires at least one Calendar connector to be enabled.
# calendarWindowMin: how far ahead (minutes) to scan for events (default 720 = 12h)
# calendarLeadMin: how many minutes before an event to brief Atlas (default 30)

# Trigger a manual heartbeat check now
curl -X POST -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/heartbeat/run
```

### Remote access (tunnel relay)

Exposes the panel to the internet via ngrok/cloudflared so a phone can reach it,
still behind the panel login. Off unless `PANEL_TUNNEL_ENABLED=true`; the relay
binary (`ngrok` or `cloudflared`) must be installed on the host.

```bash
# View tunnel config + live state (provider, hasToken, url, state, autoStart,
# basicAuth, basicAuthUser, hasPassword)
curl -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/tunnel

# Configure provider/token/domain/autoStart/basicAuth (blank authToken keeps the saved one)
curl -X PUT -H "$AUTH" -H "Content-Type: application/json" $BASE/api/tunnel \
  -d '{ "provider": "ngrok", "authToken": "vault:<id>", "domain": "", "autoStart": true, "basicAuth": true }'
# provider: "ngrok" (needs a token) | "cloudflare" (free quick tunnel, no token)
# autoStart: relaunch the relay after a reboot/update (default true)
# basicAuth: HTTP login (user "myhq" + auto-generated password) in front of the
#   public URL (default true); a password is generated + vaulted on first enable.

# Reveal the current Basic Auth login (user + plaintext password)
curl -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/tunnel/password

# Rotate to a new random password (no body) or set your own (>=6 chars)
curl -X POST -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/tunnel/password
curl -X POST -H "$AUTH" -H "Content-Type: application/json" $BASE/api/tunnel/password \
  -d '{ "password": "my-own-secret" }'

# Start / stop the relay (start returns once launched; the public URL arrives async)
curl -X POST -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/tunnel/start
curl -X POST -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/tunnel/stop
# PUT/start/stop/password all return 403 when PANEL_TUNNEL_ENABLED is false.
```

### System / status

```bash
# Live system health (CPU, memory, disk, swap, I/O)
curl -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/health

# Claude service status + provider/local backend probes
curl -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/status

# Active sessions
curl -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/sessions

# Usage summary (today + lifetime per chat)
curl -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/usage

# Recent audit log
curl -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/audit

# Search / filter the audit log. All params optional:
#   q=<text>  actor=<source>  action=<verb>  resource=<prefix>
#   since=<epoch-ms>  limit=<n, default 500>
curl -H "$AUTH" "$BASE/api/audit/search?resource=vault&action=vault.rotate&limit=100"

# Facet lists for the filter dropdowns (distinct actors / resources / actions,
# ranked by frequency).
curl -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/audit/facets

# Anomaly detector — live scan of the recent audit log (delete bursts, off-hours
# vault access, new privileged grants). Read-only preview; alerting is driven by
# the heartbeat loop (see /api/heartbeat, anomaly config).
curl -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/audit/anomalies
```

### Council votes

```bash
# Council vote history (each entry has the proposal, per-Lead votes, and tally)
curl -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/council

# Get / set the decision rule. Votes are relevance-weighted (each voter's weight
# is the proposal's relevance to their domain; 1.0 when embeddings are off).
# rule: "majority" (default) | "supermajority" (>=2/3 of decisive weight) | "unanimous"
curl -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/council/rule
curl -X PUT -H "$AUTH" -H "Content-Type: application/json" $BASE/api/council/rule \
  -d '{ "rule": "supermajority" }'

# Cross-agent delegation log
curl -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/delegations

# Worker run history across the whole fleet
curl -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/runs

# Full per-run transcript (NDJSON events: text, tool, result, start, end)
curl -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/runs/<runId>/log
```

A council vote can be triggered from Telegram with `/council <proposal>` or from the panel Crew tab:

```bash
# Trigger a council vote (returns the full tally)
curl -X POST -H "$AUTH" -H "Content-Type: application/json" $BASE/api/council \
  -d '{ "proposal": "Should we migrate to PostgreSQL?" }'

# Delete a council session (two-step confirm in the panel Crew tab)
curl -X DELETE -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/council/<id>
```

### Suggestion inbox

Agents file non-urgent ideas with `crew_suggest`; the president triages from `/inbox` or the panel Crew tab.

```bash
# List suggestions (status: pending | accepted | delegated | dismissed)
curl -H "$AUTH" "$BASE/api/suggestions?status=pending"

# Park (accept → create a backlog task card)
curl -X POST -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/suggestions/<id>/accept

# Delegate (create card + route to a Lead for immediate execution)
curl -X POST -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/suggestions/<id>/delegate

# Dismiss (archive)
curl -X POST -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/suggestions/<id>/dismiss
```

### Local model backends and embeddings

```bash
# Probe a locally running backend (reachability, models, embed-model presence)
curl -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/integrations/ollama
curl -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/integrations/lmstudio

# One-click connect: register the backend as a provider and turn embeddings on
curl -X POST -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/integrations/ollama/connect
curl -X POST -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/integrations/lmstudio/connect

# When both backends run, pick which one auto-detect prefers on startup

```

### Plan and budget

```bash
# View plan, monthly cap, billing day, alert threshold
curl -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/plan

# Update (plan: "pro" | "max" | "api")
curl -X PUT -H "$AUTH" -H "Content-Type: application/json" $BASE/api/plan \
  -d '{ "plan": "api", "monthlyCap": 100, "billingDay": 1, "alertThresholdPct": 80 }'

```

### Playbook and maintenance

```bash
# Read or write this operator playbook (work.md) and the read-only personality.
# The GET response also includes `defaultWork` (the shipped git template) and
# `matchesDefault` (false = the live playbook has been customized).
curl -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/prompt
curl -X PUT -H "$AUTH" -H "Content-Type: application/json" $BASE/api/prompt \
  -d '{ "work": "# Work Playbook\n..." }'

# Restore the playbook to the shipped default (overwrites work.md)
curl -X POST -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/prompt/restore

# Maintenance status, and trigger a compaction/pruning pass now
curl -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/maintenance
curl -X POST -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/maintenance/run

# Dry-run preview: see what would be deleted/demoted without running compaction
curl -X POST -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/maintenance/preview
```

### Task columns and WIP limits

```bash
# List columns (also returned inline by GET /api/tasks)
curl -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/tasks/columns

# Add a column
curl -X POST -H "$AUTH" -H "Content-Type: application/json" $BASE/api/tasks/columns \
  -d '{ "name": "Review" }'

# Rename a column
curl -X PUT -H "$AUTH" -H "Content-Type: application/json" $BASE/api/tasks/columns/<id> \
  -d '{ "name": "In Review" }'

# Reorder columns (send the full id order)
curl -X POST -H "$AUTH" -H "Content-Type: application/json" $BASE/api/tasks/columns/reorder \
  -d '{ "ids": ["backlog", "doing", "review", "done"] }'

# Reorder/move cards: each move is { id, column, order } — column is the
# destination column id, order is the card's new position within it.
curl -X POST -H "$AUTH" -H "Content-Type: application/json" $BASE/api/tasks/reorder \
  -d '{ "moves": [{ "id": "task-id-1", "column": "doing", "order": 0 }, { "id": "task-id-2", "column": "doing", "order": 1 }] }'

# Set a per-column WIP limit (column id + numeric limit; null/0 = unlimited)
curl -X PUT -H "$AUTH" -H "Content-Type: application/json" $BASE/api/tasks/wip \
  -d '{ "column": "doing", "limit": 3 }'

# Delete a column (its cards move back to the first column)
curl -X DELETE -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/tasks/columns/<id>

# Queue controls: pause holds dispatch of queued cards (in-flight runs keep
# going); resume fills free slots again; clear drops all waiting cards.
curl -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/tasks/queue
curl -X POST -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/tasks/queue/pause
curl -X POST -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/tasks/queue/resume
curl -X POST -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/tasks/queue/clear
```

### Web Push notifications

Browser push notifications delivered via the Web Push protocol. A VAPID keypair is auto-generated on first use and stored in the vault (private half) and `push.json` (public key + subscriptions).

```bash
# View push config: provisioned status, subscriber count, public VAPID key
curl -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/push

# Register a browser push subscription (body is the PushSubscription JSON from
# the browser's PushManager.subscribe())
curl -X POST -H "$AUTH" -H "Content-Type: application/json" $BASE/api/push/subscribe \
  -d '{ "subscription": { "endpoint": "...", "keys": { "p256dh": "...", "auth": "..." } }, "label": "my laptop" }'
# Returns { id: "<uuid>" } — store this to unsubscribe later

# Unregister a subscription
curl -X DELETE -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/push/subscribe/<id>

# Send a test notification to all registered browsers
curl -X POST -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/push/test
```

The panel UI handles subscription management automatically. Push events are sent for pending tool-call approvals, task failures, and any `push.notify()` call in server code.

### Pending approvals queue

Tool-call approvals from any Telegram chat are mirrored here so they can be resolved from the panel without touching Telegram.

```bash
# List all pending approvals (each entry has id, chatId, toolName, input, lead)
curl -H "$AUTH" $BASE/api/approvals

# Resolve an approval (id goes in the body, not the URL)
curl -X POST -H "$AUTH" -H "Content-Type: application/json" $BASE/api/approvals/resolve \
  -d '{ "id": "<id>", "action": "allow" }'
# action: "allow" | "deny" | "always"
#   allow  — approve this one call
#   deny   — refuse this one call
#   always — approve and add to the session's always-allow list
```

Approvals also broadcast over the `/ws` WebSocket (`{type:"approvals", approvals:[...]}`) so the panel can update live without polling.

### Other endpoints

A few more endpoints exist, mostly mirroring panel views:

- `GET /api/languages`: the agent language catalogue.
- `POST /api/vault/import`: scan provider tokens into the vault and rewrite them to references.
- `POST /api/workers/wizard`: draft a worker config from a plain-text description.
- `POST /api/schedules/<id>/run`: fire a schedule immediately.
- `GET /api/claude-usage`: historical activity from `~/.claude/stats-cache.json`.
- `GET /api/claude-files`, `GET|PUT /api/claude-files/content`: browse and edit on-disk `.claude/*` and `CLAUDE.md` files under known working dirs.
- `GET /api/logs`, `GET /api/logs/dates`: live ring buffer or a dated NDJSON log file (`?date=&q=&level=&limit=`).
- `GET /api/logs/search`: cross-file event search over every retained file (`?q=&level=&hours=72&limit=`), merged into one oldest-first timeline.
- `GET /api/logs/summary`: usage insights (`?hours=72`) — most-used tools and shell commands tallied from persisted "Tool use" entries.
- `GET /api/update`, `POST /api/update/check|run|restore`: in-panel update check, apply, and rollback.
- `GET /api/update/changelog`: the locally served `CHANGELOG.md` (`{ content }`); used as the Updates view's fallback when GitHub is unreachable.
- `GET /api/connectors`, `PUT /api/connectors/<id>`: the external-connector catalogue. All seventeen are live, each tagged with a `category` (`productivity`: Notion, Google Calendar, Gmail, Google Drive, Apple Calendar, Apple Mail, Slack; `dev`: GitHub, Unreal Engine, Unity; `database`: PostgreSQL, SQLite; `image`: Recraft, Ideogram, Replicate, fal.ai, Local Stable Diffusion) that the panel uses for its category filter tabs; `PUT` takes `{ enabled, secretId, scope, expiresAt }` where `scope` is `read` (default) or `write` (gates the write tools), and `expiresAt` is an optional epoch-ms credential expiry (`null` clears it, omit to leave unchanged). `GET` returns a derived `tokenStatus` of `"none" | "ok" | "expiring" | "expired"` per connector.
- `GET /api/gallery`: list generated images (`?tag=&provider=&from=&to=&q=`, epoch-ms date bounds), returns `{ images, tags }` where `tags` is every distinct tag across the whole gallery. `GET /api/gallery/<id>`: single record. `GET /api/gallery/<id>/file`: the raw image bytes (content-type derived from extension). `PUT /api/gallery/<id>`: edit tags, body `{ tags: string[] }`. `DELETE /api/gallery/<id>`: remove the record and its file. `POST /api/gallery/generate`: `{ providerId: "recraft" | "ideogram" | "replicate" | "fal" | "local_sd", prompt, size?, style?, model?, negativePrompt?, steps?, extraInput? }` — calls the same image-generation core the `<provider>_generate_image` MCP tool uses, downloads (or decodes) the result, and saves it to the gallery. `model` is required for `replicate`/`fal` (e.g. `black-forest-labs/flux-schnell`); `negativePrompt`/`steps` are `local_sd`-only; `extraInput` is a raw object merged into the replicate/fal request body for power users. Requires the connector to be enabled with a credential (for `local_sd`, the credential is the server's base URL).
- `GET /api/chat`, `POST /api/chat/send|stop|clear|approve`, `PUT /api/chat/settings`: the panel's own Claude chat session (talks to Atlas). The autonomy level is set per-chat from the toolbar (replacing the removed `PANEL_CHAT_BYPASS` env flag). `POST /api/chat/send` also accepts an optional `images` array (base64 data URLs, from attach/drag-drop/paste in the composer) passed to the agent as inline vision content.
- `POST /api/chat/react`: react to an assistant reply with `{ reaction: "up" | "down", text }`. A thumbs-up files the response text as a durable memory; a thumbs-down is recorded. Returns 400 for any other reaction.
- `POST /api/chat/approve`: resolve a pending tool-call approval raised inside the panel chat itself, `{ approvalId, allow }` — the chat analogue of `POST /api/approvals/resolve`.
- `GET /api/asks`, `POST /api/asks/resolve`: the pending `AskUserQuestion` queue and its resolver, used to render interactive question widgets in panel chat. Resolve with `{ id, optionIndices?, text? }`.
- `GET /api/agent-chat/<id>`, `POST /api/agent-chat/<id>/send|stop|clear`, `PUT /api/agent-chat/<id>/settings`: an interactive chat with a specific worker/Lead by id. `POST /api/agent-chat/<id>/send` accepts the same optional `images` array as the main chat.
- `GET /api/usage/agents`: per-agent token + cost totals and a daily-by-role breakdown.
- `GET /api/memories/stats`: counts by tier and embedding coverage.
- `POST /api/agent/embeddings/auto`: re-enter embeddings auto-mode (clears the pin and re-probes the local backends).
- `POST /api/feedback`: relay a bug report / suggestion `{ kind, message, email? }` to the central collector (`FEEDBACK_URL`).
- `GET /api/me`: read-only deployment facts (version, brand/agent name, allowed-user count, panel host/port, tunnel/terminal flags) for the Setup view.
- `GET /api/terminal`, `POST /api/terminal/spawn|resize`: the panel terminal session.
- `GET /api/conversations/search`: hybrid (cosine + keyword) search across the live chat history and on-disk run transcripts (`?q=&limit=`), returning ranked hits with an extracted snippet and source (`chat` | `run`).
- `GET|PUT /api/branding`: the white-label branding draft (product/agent name, panel title, logo, favicon, colours, email footer). Overrides are only *applied* (folded into `GET /api/me`) when `BRANDING_UNLOCKED=true`; otherwise the draft persists but the env-default names are served.
