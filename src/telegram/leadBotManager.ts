 * a specific task assigned.
 *
 * {@link sync} reconciles the running set against `workers.leads()` and is
 * idempotent, so it can be called on boot and on every registry mutation
 * (create/update/delete) to bring Leads online/offline live, no restart needed.
 *
 * A Lead's Telegraf `launch()` can end on its own — most notably a 409
 * Conflict when a second `getUpdates` poller grabs the same token — without
 * the worker registry changing at all. `sync()` alone would never notice
 * (its "already running" check just sees the stale map entry and skips it),
 * so a periodic watchdog re-runs `sync()`, and `sync()` itself now treats a
 * `!bot.isRunning()` entry the same as a missing one: drop it and let the
 * normal "start bots for desired Leads" pass bring it back.
