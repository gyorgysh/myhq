/**
 * Bot-side i18n catalog (English, the source of truth).
 *
 * These are the bot's OWN user-facing operational strings (status lines,
 * approval buttons, error fallbacks, flow toasts) — NOT model output and NOT
 * log lines. Keys are flat with an area prefix (e.g. `appr_`, `git_`). Use
 * `{name}` placeholders for interpolation, filled by `t(key, lang, vars)`.
 *
 * Add every new key here first; `TranslationKey` is derived from this object so
 * other locales (and call sites) are checked against it at compile time.
