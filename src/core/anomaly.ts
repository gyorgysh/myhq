 * heartbeat loop calls {@link detectAnomalies} on its tick and routes any
 * findings through the existing Telegram/push alert path.
 *
 * The three built-in rules mirror the ones the card called out:
 *  - a burst of deletes in a short window (data-destruction spike),
 *  - vault access outside configured working hours (off-hours secret access),
 *  - addition of a new privileged grant (new vault credential / access grant),
 *    the runtime analogue of "a new allowed user was added".
